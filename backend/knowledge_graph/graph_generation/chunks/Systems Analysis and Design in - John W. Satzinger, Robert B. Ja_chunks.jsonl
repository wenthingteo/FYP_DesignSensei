Systems design involves specifying in detail how a system will work when \ndeployed within a specific technology environment. Some of the details may \nhave been defined during systems analysis, but much more detail is added dur-\ning design. In addition, each part of the final solution is heavily influenced by \nthe design of all the other parts. Thus, systems design activities are usually done \nin parallel. For example, the database design influences the design of application \ncomponents, software classes and methods, and the user interface. Likewise, the \ntechnology environment drives many of the decisions for how system functions \nare distributed across application components and how those components com-\nmunicate across a network.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

When an iterative approach to the SDLC is used, \nmajor design decisions are made in the first or second iteration; however, many \ndecisions are revisited and refined during later iterations. To better understand these design activities, you can summarize each one \nwith a question. In fact, system developers often ask themselves these questions \nto help them stay focused on the objective of each design activity.

{"text": "features: Information systems used to be focused \non processing internal data; however, today, these retail \nchains want suppliers to become part of a totally inte-\ngrated supply chain system. In other words, the systems \nneed to communicate between companies to make the \nsupply chain more efficient. To maintain its position as a leading wholesale dis-\ntributor, Electronics Unlimited has to convert its system to \nlink with its suppliers (the manufacturers of the electronic \nequipment) and its customers (the retailers). It is develop-\ning a completely new system that uses object-oriented \ntechniques to provide these links. Object-oriented tech-\nniques facilitate system-to-system interfaces by using \npredefined components and objects to accelerate the \ndevelopment process. Fortunately, many of the system \ndevelopment staff members have experience with object-\noriented development and are eager to apply the tech-\nniques and models to the system development project. William Jones is explaining object-oriented develop-\nment to the group of systems analysts who are being \ntrained in this approach. \u201cWe\u2019re developing most of our new systems by \nusing object-oriented principles,\u201d he tells them. \u201cThe \ncomplexity of the new system, along with its interactiv-\nity, makes the object-oriented approach a natural way to \ndevelop requirements. The object-oriented models track \nvery closely with the new object-oriented programming \nlanguages and frameworks.\u201d\nWilliam is just getting warmed up. \u201cThis way of thinking about a system in terms of \nobjects is very interesting,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is also consis-\ntent with the object-oriented programming techniques \nyou learned in your programming classes. You prob-\nably first learned to think about objects when you de-\nveloped screens for the user interface. All the controls \non the screen, such as buttons, text boxes, and drop-\ndown boxes, are objects. Each has its own set of trigger \nevents that activate its program functions.\u201d\n\u201cHow does this apply to our situation?\u201d one of the \nanalysts asks. \u201cYou just extend that thought process,\u201d William \nexplains.\u201d You think of such things as purchase orders \nand employees as objects, too. We can call them the \nproblem domain objects to differentiate them from user-\ninterface objects, such as windows and buttons. During \nanalysis, we have to find out all the trigger events and \nmethods associated with each business object.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how do we do that?\u201d another analyst asks. \u201cYou continue with your fact-finding activities and \nbuild a better understanding of each use case,\u201d William \nsays.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

One method of determining which objects \ncollaborate is to use class responsibility collaboration \n(CRC) cards. For simple use cases, a set of CRC cards \nmay be sufficient to write code. For more complex use \ncases, other interaction diagrams are normally used. One reason that we suggest a more formal system \nof design, rather than just starting to write code is \nthat the final system is much more robust and main-\ntainable. Design as a rigorous activity builds better \nsystems. Some fundamental principles should be con-\nsidered as a system is developed; specifically, two criti-\ncal ideas are coupling and cohesion. A good system \nhas low coupling between the classes, and each of the \nclasses has high cohesion. Another important principle \nis \u201cprotection from variations,\u201d meaning that some \nparts of the system should be protected from and not \ntightly coupled to other parts of the system that are \nless stable and subject to change.

The ultimate responsibility of system developers is to \nwrite computer software that solves a business prob-\nlem.

Chapters 3 and 4 teach modeling techniques for capturing the detailed \nrequirements for the system in a useful form.

In this scenario, there is the owner of the\u00a0land \nwho has the vision, the builder who will construct the building, and the archi-\ntect who serves as the bridge between the owner and the builder. The\u00a0\u00ad\narchitect \nhelps the owner develop the vision, but must also communicate the building\u2019s \nspecifications to the builder. In doing so, the architect uses various tools to \nfirst capture the vision from the owner and to then provide the builder with \ninstructions\u2014including line drawings, blueprints, to-scale models, detail speci-\nfications, and even on-site inspection reports. Just as a builder doesn\u2019t start construction without plans, programmers \ndon\u2019t just sit down and start writing program code. They need someone (maybe \nthemselves) to function like an architect\u2014planning, capturing the vision, un-\nderstanding details, specifying needs\u2014before designing and writing the code \nthat satisfies the vision. Usually, we call this person a systems analyst. In sit-\nuations where you are the programmer as well as the analyst (often called a \nprogrammer-analyst), it might be possible to keep track of the details without \nmany formal notes. However, in today\u2019s world, with system development teams \noften distributed worldwide, you might only be responsible for part of the pro-\ngramming, with the rest handled by team members in different locations. In a \ndistributed team situation or with a complicated project, it is much more impor-\ntant to create formal requirements documents that capture each components\u2019 \nspecifications. In a nutshell, systems analysis and design provides the tools and techniques \nyou need as an information system developer to complete the development \nprocess:\n1. Understand the need (business need). 2. Capture the vision. 3. Define a solution. 4. Communicate the vision and the solution. 5. Build the solution or direct others in building the solution. 6. Confirm that the solution meets the need. 7. Launch the solution application.

{"text": "7: CHAPTER 1 \u25a0 From Beginning to End: An Overview of Systems Analysis and Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)\nInitial development of a new information system is usually done as a project. A\u00a0project is a planned undertaking that has a beginning and an end and pro-\nduces some end result. This means that the activities required to develop a new \nsystem are identified, planned, organized, and monitored. Some projects are \nvery formal, whereas others are informal, usually depending on the project size. To manage a project with analysis, design, and other development activi-\nties, you need a project management framework to guide and coordinate the \nwork of the project team. The system development life cycle (SDLC) is a \nframework that identifies all the activities required to research, build, deploy, \nand often maintain an information system. Normally, the SDLC includes all ac-\ntivities needed for the planning, systems analysis, systems design, programming, \ntesting, and user training stages of information systems development, as well as \nother project management activities that are required to successfully deploy the \nnew information system. There are many approaches to the SDLC, including variations specific to cer-\ntain types of projects. However, every SDLC includes some core processes that \nare always required, though many different names are used. Here are the six core \nprocesses required in the development of any information system (see Figure 1-4):\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIdentify the problem or need and obtain approval to proceed with the project. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nPlan and monitor the project\u2014what to do, how to do it, and who does it. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nDiscover and understand the details of the problem or the need\u2014what is \nrequired? \u25a0\n\u25a0\nDesign the system components that solve the problem or satisfy the need\u2014\nhow will it actually work? \u25a0\n\u25a0\nBuild, test, and integrate system components\u2014lots of programming and \ncomponent integration. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nComplete system tests and then deploy the solution\u2014the need now is \nsatisfied. As previously stated, most information systems you will develop are con-\nceived and built to solve complex organizational problems, which are usually \nvery complex, thus making it difficult to plan and manage a system development \nproject. Fortunately, there are many ways to implement the six core processes of \nthe SDLC to handle each project\u2019s complexity.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "8: PART 1 \u25a0 Introduction to System Development\nmethodology prescribes a way of carrying out the development project, and ev-\nery organization develops its own system development methodology over time \nto suit its needs. During the last 15 years, information system research efforts have resulted \nin many new information systems development methodologies/processes to im-\nprove the chance of project success. These are all based on what is called Agile \ndevelopment. The basic philosophy of Agile development is that neither team \nmembers nor the users completely understand the problems and complexities \nof a new system, so the project plan and the execution of the project must be \nresponsive to unanticipated issues. The plan must be agile and flexible. It must \nhave procedures in place to allow for, anticipate, and even embrace changes and \nnew requirements that come up during the development process. The six core \nprocesses are still involved in Agile development, but they are carried out itera-\ntively, as explained next. \u25a0\n\u25a0Iterative Development\nIterative development is an approach to system development in which the sys-\ntem is \u201cgrown\u201d in an almost organic fashion. Core components are developed \nfirst and then additional components are added. It is called iterative because the \nsix core development processes are repeated for each component. In\u00a0other words, \nthere is one big project, which consists of a series of mini-projects, and the in-\nformation system is grown piece by piece during these mini-projects. \u00ad\nIterative \ndevelopment makes Agile development possible, although Agile development in-\ncludes additional techniques that help with project flexibility, too. Figure 1-5 illustrates how an iterative project might be managed. Across \nthe figure, you see six iterations as columns. Each iteration involves all six core \nprocesses, shown as rows in the table. At the end of each iteration, a working \npart of the system is completed and evaluated. An iteration lasts a fixed period \nof time, usually two to four weeks. The rounded mounds inside the graph rep-\nresent the relative amount of effort for that core process during that iteration. For example, in Figure 1\u20135, Iteration 1 appears to primarily focus on identify-\ning the problem and planning the project. Lesser amounts of discovery, design, \nand build/test may also be done. For this iteration, nothing is done with regard \nto deploying the system.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W. Satzinger, Robert B.

In our case, the team decides that the Supplier Information \u00ad\nSubsystem \nshould be scheduled for the first iteration and the Product \u00ad\nInformation Subsys-\ntem should be scheduled for the second iteration.

Sometimes, this organized list of tasks is called a work breakdown struc-\nture (WBS). Figure 1-9 shows the WBS for this iteration. Part of this effort is trying to estimate how long each task will take. Because \nthis iteration has a very limited scope (and only six days), all the estimates will \nbe in hours. These estimates do not include the time expended by those who are \nnot on the team.

{"text": "22: PART 1 \u25a0 Introduction to System Development\nDatabase design is a fairly straightforward activity that uses the domain class \ndiagram and develops the detailed database schema that can be directly imple-\nmented by a database management system. Such elements as table design, key \nand index identification, attribute types, and other efficiency decisions are made \nduring this activity. Designing the high-level system structure and the individual programs can \nbe an intricate and complex process. First, the overall structure of the system is \ndesigned by identifying the subsystems and connections to other systems. Then, \nwithin each subsystem, decisions are made about individual program modules, \nsuch as the user interface, business logic, and database access. It is not uncommon for developers to begin writing program code as they \n\u00ad\ndevelop portions of the design. However, best practice suggests that the designer \ncomplete most of the high-level structure design before writing code. Consequently, \nin the RMO Tradeshow System project, we will list them as separate activities. \u275a\n\u275aDesigning the Database\nDesigning the database uses the information provided by the domain class dia-\ngram to determine the tables, the columns in the tables, and other components. Sometimes, the database design is done for the entire system at once or by subsys-\ntem. At other times, it is built piecemeal\u2014use case by use case.

Figure 1-19 is a preliminary \ndesign class diagram for the Supplier Information Subsystem that identifies \nthe software classes needed for the system (for example, the SupplierView and \nContactView classes). In Figure 1-19, we show only the problem domain de-\nsign classes and the user-interface View layer classes. Problem domain design \nclasses are usually derived from those classes that were identified during analy-\nsis activities\u2014hence, the name: problem (user need) domain design classes. You \nwill also notice that they very closely correspond to the database tables; in fact, \nin this simple project, they are almost exactly the same as the database tables. The design classes in Figure 1-19 include the attributes that are needed for \nthe class. They also include method names of the important methods within \neach class. One final element in the design class diagram is the arrows that show \nwhere a class accesses the methods of another class. \u275a\n\u275aDesigning Subsystem Software Architecture\nOnce we have an overall structure and approach for implementing the new sys-\ntem, we begin to drill down to the software design for the subsystem. \u00ad\nFigure\u00a01-20 \nillustrates the design of the Supplier Information Subsystem.

For example, the \nsystem will be browser based, but different browsers require different techniques. It is better not to get these complexities mixed in with the basic program func-\ntions. Hence, they are separated out into a distinct layer. +lookupSupplier ( )\n+displaySupplier ( )\nSupplierView\n+lookUpContact ( )\n+displayContact ( )\nContactView\n\u2013supplierID {key}\nname: string\naddress: string\naddress2: string\ncity: string\nstate: string\ncountry: string\nURL: string\ncomments: string\nSupplier\n\u2013contactID {key}\n\u2013name: string {index}\ntitle: string\nwaddress1: string\nwaddress2: string\nwcity: string\nwstate: string\nwpostal: string\nwcountry: string\nwphone: string\nmobilephone: string\nemail1: string\nemail2: string\ncomments: string\nContact\n+getSupplierInfo ( )\n+getContactInfo ( )\nFigure 1-19 Preliminary design \nclass diagram\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

In our project, we have sepa-\nrated the tasks for designing the overall system structure from detailed design of \nthe programs themselves. However, these activities are often done concurrently. The basic high-level software architectural structure is defined first, but mid-\nlevel and low-level design are often done concurrently with programming. Detailed design and programming are quite time-consuming activities. A\u00a0project manager must decide whether to extend the project or bring on ad-\nditional programmers to help write the code. In our project, we have elected to \ninsert a half-day of free time to bring in two additional programmers and train \nthem. Of course, we could go ahead and begin Day 5\u2019s activities to ensure that \nwe keep the project on schedule. \u25a0\n\u25a0Day 5 Activities\nAs mentioned previously, though detailed design and programming may begin \nearlier in the project, we identify it as a separate day\u2019s activity. We want to em-\nphasize that it is not a good practice to begin programming before critical in-\nformation is obtained and decisions are made.

Day 5 activities include the following (Core 5 Process):\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCreate detail design. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nProgram the subsystem components. As the programmers write the code, they also perform individual testing \non the classes and functions they program. This textbook does not focus on \nprogramming activities. However, we include an example of program code so \nyou can see how systems design relates to the final program code. Figure 1-21 \nshows PHP code that defines the SupplierView class that receives and processes \nthe request for supplier information. Note that it sends a message to the Supplier \nclass requesting information when needed. \u25a0\n\u25a0Day 6 Activities\nThe focus of Day 6 activities is final testing, a step that is required before the \nsystem is ready to be deployed. Although there are many types of testing, we \nmention only two types at this time: overall system functional testing and user \nacceptance testing. Functional testing is usually a test of all user functions and \nis often done by a quality assurance team. User acceptance tests are similar in \nnature, but these are completed by the users, who test both the correctness of \nthe system and its \u201cfitness\u201d to accomplish the business requirements. Each of the various testing activities in Day 6 has a similar sequence of tasks \nto perform. The tasks themselves highly depend on the test data and on the \nmethod for testing a particular test case. In some instances, the testing may be \nautomated. In others, individuals may need to manually conduct the tests. <?php\n    class SupplierView \n    { \n        private Supplier $theSupplier; \n        function __construct() \n        { \n            $this->theSupplier = new Supplier(); \n        } \n        function lookupSupplier()\n        { \n          include('lookupSupplier.inc.html'); \n        } \n        function displaySupplier() \n        { \n         \n  include('displaySupplierTop.inc.html'); \n       \n  extract($_REQUEST);   // get Form data    \n \n \n//Call Supplier class to retrieve the data \n            $results = $theSupplier->getSupplierInfo($supplier, $category, \n                                            $product, $country, $contact); \n           foreach ($results as $resultItem){ \n           ?> \n                   <tr> \n                       <td style=\"border:1px solid black\"> \n                             <?php echo $resultItem->supplierName?></td> \n                       <td style=\"border:1px solid black\"> \n                              <?php echo $resultItem->contactName?></td> \n                       <td style=\"border:1px solid black\"> \n                          <?php echo $resultItem->contactPosition?></td> \n                   </tr> \n            <?php } \n            include('displaySupplierFoot.inc.html'); \n        } \n    } \n?>\nFigure 1-21 Code for the \n\u00ad\nSupplierView class\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Chapter 6 provides broad and comprehensive coverage of important \nconcepts and activities of systems design. It serves not only as a broad overview \nof design principles, but also as a foundation for later chapters that explain the \ndetailed techniques, tasks, skills, and models used to carry out design. Chapter 7 covers key aspects of architectural design. System interfaces oc-\ncur when one information system communicates or interacts with another in-\nformation system without human intervention. System interfaces are becoming \nincreasingly important because of Web services and cloud computing. Other re-\nlated concepts, such as controls and security, are also presented in this chapter. Chapter 8 presents design principles related to the user. Designing the user \ninterface requires a combination of analysis and design. It is related to analysis \nbecause it requires heavy user involvement and includes specifying user activities \nand desires. On the other hand, it is a design activity because it specifies final \ncomponents that are used to drive the programming effort. The pages, forms, \nreports, and other user interaction components must be precisely designed so \nthey can be programmed as part of the final system. Chapter 9 explains how to design the database from the information gleaned \nduring analysis and the identification of the domain classes. \u25a0\n\u25a0Part 4: Projects and Project Management\nBy this point, you will have a basic understanding of all the elements of system \ndevelopment.

RMO also instituted a Mountain Bucks program where customers accumu-\nlate credits that can be used to redeem prizes as well as purchase merchandise. Customers may use these Mountain Bucks for themselves or they may transfer \nthem to other people in their family/friends group. This is a great opportunity \nto combine accumulated bucks to obtain expensive merchandise. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nThe Marketing subsystem is primarily for employees to set up the infor-\nmation and services for customers.

These points can be used at \nRMO or transferred and used at the partner. For example, because RMO \nsells outdoor and sporting clothing, it has partnered with various sporting \ngoods stores. That way, a person can buy sporting equipment at the sport-\ning equipment store and get promotional discounts for clothing at RMO.

We further discuss the distinction between func-\ntional and nonfunctional requirements a bit later in this chapter. Defining requirements is not just a matter of writing down facts and figures. Instead, the analyst creates models to record requirements, reviews the mod-\nels with users and others, and refines and expands the models to reflect new \nor updated information. In Chapter 1, you learned about requirements models, \nsuch as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and domain model class diagrams. Building and refining requirements models occupies much of the analyst\u2019s time. This chapter and the next two chapters explain in considerable depth how to \ncreate requirements models.

{"text": "44: PART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Prioritize Requirements\nOnce the system requirements are well understood, it is important to establish \nwhich requirements are most crucial for the system. Sometimes, users request \nadditional system functions that are desirable but not essential. However, users \nand analysts need to ask themselves which functions are truly important and \nwhich are fairly important but not absolutely required. Again, an analyst who \nunderstands the organization and the work done by the users will have more \ninsight toward answering these questions. Why prioritize the functions requested by the users? Resources are always \nlimited, and the analyst must always be prepared to justify the scope of the sys-\ntem. Therefore, it is important to know what is absolutely required. Unless the \nanalyst carefully evaluates priorities, system requirements tend to expand as \nusers make more suggestions (a phenomenon called scope creep). Requirements \npriorities also help to determine the number, composition, and ordering of proj-\nect iterations. High-priority requirements are often incorporated into early proj-\nect iterations so analysts and users have ample opportunity to refine those parts \nof the system. Furthermore, a project with many high-priority requirements will \ntypically have many iterations. \u25a0\n\u25a0Develop User-Interface Dialogs\nIn some cases, when a new system is replacing an old system that does similar \nwork, users are usually quite sure about their requirements and the desired form \nof the user interface. In other cases, the system development project breaks new \nground by automating functions that were previously performed manually or by \nimplementing functions that were not performed in the past. In either case, users \ntend to be uncertain of many aspects of system requirements. Such requirements \nmodels as use cases, activity diagrams, and interaction diagrams can be devel-\noped based on user input, but it is often difficult for users to interpret and vali-\ndate such abstract models. In comparison, user validation of a user interface is much simpler and more \nreliable because the user can see and feel the system. To most users, the user \ninterface is all that matters. Thus, developing user-interface dialogs is a powerful \nmethod of eliciting and documenting requirements. Analysts can develop user \ninterfaces via abstract models, such as interaction diagrams and written dialogs \n(covered in more detail in later chapters), or they can develop storyboards or \nuser-interface prototypes on the actual input/output devices that users will use \n(e.g., a computer monitor, iPad, or smartphone).", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

A prototype interface can serve \nas a requirement and a starting point for developing a portion of the system. A\u00a0user-interface prototype developed in an early iteration can be expanded in \nlater iterations to become a fully functioning part of the system. \u25a0\n\u25a0Evaluate Requirements with Users\nIdeally, evaluating requirements with users and documenting the requirements are \nfully integrated. But in practice, users generally have other responsibilities besides \ndeveloping a new system. Thus, analysts usually use an iterative process in which \nthey elicit user input to model requirements, return to the user for additional input \nor validation, and then work alone to incorporate the new input and refine the \nmodels. Prototypes of user interfaces and other parts of the system may also be \ndeveloped when \u201cpaper\u201d models are inadequate or when users and analysts need \nto prove that chosen technologies will do what they are supposed to do. Also, if \nthe system will include new or innovative technology, the users may need help \nvisualizing the possibilities available from the new technology as they define what \nthey require. Prototypes can fill that need. The processes of eliciting requirements, \nbuilding models and prototypes, and evaluating them with users may repeat many \ntimes until requirements models and prototypes are complete and accurate.

Modifying the system after customers start \ncomplaining is much more difficult and expensive than building in the rule from \nthe start. Nonfunctional requirements are characteristics of the system other than \nthose activities it must perform or support. It is not always easy to distinguish \nfunctional from nonfunctional requirements. One way to do so is to use a frame-\nwork for identifying and classifying requirements. There have been many such \nframeworks developed over time; the most widely used today is referred to as \nFURPS (see Figure 2-3). FURPS is an acronym that stands for functional, \nusability, reliability, performance, and security. The F in FURPS is equivalent to \nthe functional requirements defined previously. The remaining categories (URPS) \ndescribe nonfunctional requirements as follows:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nusability requirements describe operational characteristics related to \nusers, such as the user interface, related work procedures, online help, \nand documentation.

For exam-\nple, the client portion of a system might be required to have a .5 second \nresponse time to all button presses, and the server might need to support \n100 simultaneous client sessions (with the same response time). \u25a0\n\u25a0\nSecurity requirements describe how access to the application will be \ncontrolled and how data will be protected during storage and transmission. For example, the application might be password protected, encrypt locally \nstored data with 1024-bit keys, and use secure HTTP for communication \namong client and server nodes. \u25a0\n\u25a0Additional Requirements Categories\nFURPS+  is an extension of FURPS that adds additional categories, including \ndesign constraints as well as implementation, system interface, physical, and \nsupportability requirements\u2014all these additional categories summarized by the \nplus sign. Here are short descriptions of each category:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDesign constraints describe restrictions to which the hardware and soft-\nware must adhere. For example, a cell phone application might be required \nto use the Android operating system, consume no more than 30 MB of \nflash memory storage, consume no more than 10 MB of system memory \nwhile running, and operate on CPUs rated at 1 GHz or higher. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nImplementation requirements describe constraints such as required pro-\ngramming languages and tools, documentation method and level of detail, \nand a specific communication protocol for distributed components. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nInterface requirements describe interactions among systems. For example, \na financial reporting system for a publicly traded company in the United \nStates must generate data for the Securities and Exchange Commis-\nsion (SEC) in a specific XML format. The system might also supply data \ndirectly to stock exchanges and bond rating agencies, and automatically \ngenerate Twitter messages, RSS feeds, and Facebook updates. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nPhysical requirements describe such characteristics of hardware as size, \nweight, power consumption, and operating conditions. For example, a system \nthat supports battlefield communications might have such requirements as \nweighing less than 200 grams, being no larger than 5 centimeters cubed, and \noperating for 48 hours on a fully charged 1200 milliwatt lithium ion\u00a0battery. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nSupportability requirements describe how a system is installed, configured, moni-\ntored, and updated.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Software Quality Attributes", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "47: CHAPTER 2 \u25a0 Investigating System Requirements\nIs a restriction to use no more than 100 megabytes of memory a performance or \ndesign requirement? Is a requirement to secure communication between work-\nstations and servers with 1024-bit encryption a performance, design, or imple-\nmentation requirement? What is important is that all requirements be identified \nand precisely stated early in the development process and that inconsistencies or \ntrade-offs among them be resolved. \u25a0\n\u25a0Stakeholders\nStakeholders are your primary source of information for system requirements. Stakeholders are all the people who have an interest in the successful imple-\nmentation of the system. Depending on the nature and scope of the system, this \ncan be a small group, or a large, diverse group. For example, when implement-\ning a comprehensive accounting system for a publicly traded corporation in the \nUnited States, the stakeholders include bookkeepers, accountants, managers and \nexecutives, customers, suppliers, auditors, investors, the SEC, and the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS). Each stakeholder group interacts with the system in dif-\nferent ways, and each has a unique perspective on system requirements. Before \ngathering detailed information, the analyst identifies every type of stakeholder \nwho has an interest in the new system and ensures that critical people from each \nstakeholder category are available to serve as the business experts. One useful way to help identify all the interested stakeholders is to con-\nsider two dimensions by which they vary: internal stakeholders versus exter-\nnal stakeholders and operational stakeholders versus executive stakeholders \n(see Figure\u00a02-4). Internal stakeholders are those within the organization \nwho interact with the system or have a significant interest in its operation or \nsuccess. You may be tempted to define internal stakeholders as employees of \nan organization, but some organizations\u2014such as nonprofits and educational \ninstitutions\u2014have internal users (e.g., volunteers and students) who are not \nemployees.

Operational users are a key source of requirements information, especially as it \npertains to user interfaces and related functionality.

Examples include an organization\u2019s senior managers and \nboard of directors, regulatory agencies, and taxing authorities. Including such stakeholders in analysis activities is critical because the infor-\nmation they possess may not be obvious or widely known in the organization. In addition, system requirements imposed by executive stakeholders, especially \nexternal ones, often have significant legal and financial implications.

Second, existing inputs, \noutputs, and documents can serve as visual aids for the interview and as the \nworking documents for discussion (see Figure 2-11). Discussion can focus on a \nspecific input or output, its objective, its distribution, and its information con-\ntent. The discussion should also include specific business events that initiate \nthe use of an input or generation of an output. Several different business events \nmight require the same form, and specific information about the event and the \nbusiness process is critical. It is always helpful to have screens and forms that \nhave been filled out with real information to ensure that the analyst obtains a \ncorrect understanding of the data content. Reviewing the documentation of existing procedures helps identify busi-\nness rules that may not come up in the interviews. Analyzing formal procedure \ndocumentation also helps reveal discrepancies and redundancies in the business \nprocesses. However, procedure documents frequently are not kept up to date, \nand they commonly include errors. To ensure that the assumptions and business \nrules that derive from the existing documentation are correct, analysts should \nreview them with the users. \u25a0\n\u25a0Observe and Document Business Processes\nFirsthand experience is invaluable to understand exactly what occurs within \nbusiness processes.

Users and other stakeholders perform the initial testing of system \nfunctions during the iteration in which those functions are implemented. They \nalso test and use those same functions during later iterations. User feedback from initial and later testing is a valuable source of require-\nments information. Yet, interviews, discussions, and model reviews are an \nimperfect way of eliciting complete and accurate requirements. The phrase \u201cI\u2019ll \nknow it when I see it\u201d applies well to requirements definition. Users often can-\nnot completely or accurately state their requirements until they can interact with \na live system that implements those requirements. Based on those interactions, \nusers can develop concrete suggestions for improvement and identify missing or \npoorly implemented requirements. \u25a0\n\u25a0Models and Modeling\nModeling is an important part of systems analysis and design. You saw many \ndifferent models in Chapter 1 for the Tradeshow System. Analysts build mod-\nels to describe system requirements and use those models to communicate with \nusers and designers. By developing a model and reviewing it with a user, an ana-\nlyst demonstrates an understanding of the user\u2019s requirements. If the user spots \nerrors or omissions, they are incorporated into the model before it becomes the \nbasis for subsequent design and implementation activities. Figure 2-12 summa-\nrizes the key reasons for building and using models. Designers construct high-level and detailed models to describe system \ncomponents and their interactions. Design models serve as a scratch pad for \nevaluating design alternatives and as a way to communicate the final design to \nprogrammers, vendors, and others who will build, acquire, and assemble com-\nponents to create the final system. In general, models built during one SDLC \nactivity are \u201cconsumed\u201d during other activities. A model is a representation or abstraction of some aspect of the system \nbeing built. There are dozens of different models that an analyst or designer \nmight develop and use (see Figure 2-13). Although this book emphasizes mod-\nels and techniques for creating models, it is important to remember that system \nprojects vary in the number of models required and in their formality. Smaller, \nsimpler system projects will not need models showing every system detail, par-\nticularly when the project team has experience with the type of system being \nbuilt. Sometimes, the key models are created informally in a few hours.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W. Satzinger, Robert B.

{"text": "59: CHAPTER 2 \u25a0 Investigating System Requirements\nAnalysis and design models can be grouped into three generic types:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nTextual models. Analysts use such textual models as memos, reports, \nnarratives, and lists to describe requirements that are detailed and are diffi-\ncult to represent in other ways. The event list and use case descriptions (see \nicons shown in Figure 2-13) are two examples of textual models. Narrative \ndescription is often the best way to initially record information gathered \nverbally from stakeholders, such as during an interview. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nGraphical models. Graphical models make it easier to understand com-\nplex relationships that are difficult to follow when described as a list or \nnarrative. Recall the old saying that a picture is worth a thousand words. In system development, a carefully constructed graphical model might be \nworth a million words! Some graphical models actually look similar to a \nreal-world part of the system, such as a screen design or a report layout \ndesign.

{"text": "60: PART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nunderstand a variety of specific diagrams used in a system development project. Prior to UML, there was no standard, so diagrams could be confusing, and they \nvaried from company to company (and from book to book). In later chapters, you will learn how to develop many of these analysis and \ndesign models. The first UML diagram covered in detail is the activity diagram. \u25a0\n\u25a0Documenting Workflows with Activity Diagrams\nAs you gather information about business processes, you will need to document \nyour results as a workflow. A workflow is the sequence of work steps that com-\nplete one business transaction or customer request. Workflows may be simple or \ncomplex. Complex workflows can be composed of dozens or hundreds of work \nsteps and may include participants from different parts of an organization. One effective way to capture this information is with a UML activity dia-\ngram. An activity diagram describes the various user (or system) activities, the \nperson or component that completes each activity, and the sequential flow of \nthese activities. Figure 2-14 shows the basic symbols used in an activity diagram. The flat-\ntened ovals represent the individual activities in a workflow. The connecting \narrows represent the sequence of the activities. The black circles denote the \nbeginning and the ending of the workflow. The diamond is a decision point at \nwhich the flow of the process will either follow one path or another. The heavy \nsolid line is a synchronization bar, which either splits the path into multiple \nconcurrent paths or recombines concurrent paths. The swimlane represents an \nagent who performs the activities. It is called a swimlane because each agent fol-\nlows a path parallel with other agents in the workflow, as with swimmers in a \nswimming pool. Figure 2-15 is an activity diagram that describes the order fulfillment pro-\ncess for the current RMO CSMS. Processing begins when the customer has \ncompleted the order checkout process and the warehouse begins order fulfill-\nment. The diagram describes the back-and-forth flow of information and con-\ntrol between the order subsystem, inventory subsystem, warehouse(s), and \nshipper. The diagram is simplified because it omits many error-handling path-\nways, including what happens if enough item stock is on hand to fulfill only part \nof an order.", "domains": ["Design Principles", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

Monitoring that once \nrequired a visit to a health-care facility can now be \nperformed by devices located in a patient\u2019s home, or \ncarried or worn at all times. Examples include mea-\nsures of glucose level (blood sugar), pulse, blood pres-\nsure, and electrocardiogram (EKG). Measurements \ncan be transmitted via telephone, Internet connection, \nand wireless data transmission standards, such as \nBluetooth. A particularly powerful technology combi-\nnation is a wearable device that records data periodi-\ncally or continuously and transmits it via Bluetooth to \na cell phone app. The cell phone app can inform the \npatient of problems and can automatically transmit \ndata and alerts to a central monitoring application (see \nFigure 2-17). Health-care providers and patients incur sig-\nnificant costs when glucose levels are not maintained \nwithin acceptable tolerances. Short-term episodes of \nvery high or very low glucose often result in expensive \nvisits to urgent care clinics or hospitals. In addition, \npatients with frequent but less severe episodes of high \nor low glucose are more susceptible to such expensive, \nlong-term complications as vision, circulatory, and \nkidney problems.

{"text": "73: CHAPTER 3 \u25a0 Identifying User Stories and Use Cases\nA use case is an activity the system performs in response to a request by \na user. In Chapter 1, the RMO Tradeshow System example had a list of uses \nthat included Look up supplier, Enter/update product information, and Look \nup product information. Two techniques are recommended for identifying use \ncases: the user goal technique and the event decomposition technique. Use case \ntechniques place the responsibility for identifying and detailing the require-\nments on the system developers. The developers typically interview all types \nof users and stakeholders, and then make and refine notes about each use case. Some of the more complex use cases are modeled in more detail by the develop-\ners before turning the uses cases over to the programmer analysts for design \nand implementation. \u25a0\n\u25a0Use Cases and the User Goal Technique\n\u201cUser stories will help analysts identify and define use cases, which are the pri-\nmary focus of this chapter.\u201d\nOne approach to identifying use cases, called the user goal technique, is \nto ask users to describe their goals for using the new or updated system. The \nanalyst first identifies all the users, categorizes them by user type, and then con-\nducts a structured interview with each user. By focusing on one type of user at a \ntime, the analyst can systematically address the problem of identifying use cases. During the interview, the analyst guides the user to identify specific ways \nthe computer system could help the user perform his or her assigned tasks. The\u00a0overarching objective is to identify what the system could do to improve the \nuser\u2019s performance and productivity. Subsidiary goals might include streamlin-\ning tasks the user currently performs, or enabling the user to perform new tasks \nthat are not possible or practical with the current system. As these goals are \nuncovered and described, the analyst probes for specific requests from the user \nand desired responses from the proposed system, which the analyst documents \nas use cases. Although the users are the ultimate source of this information, they \noften require guidance from the analyst to think beyond the boundaries of the \nways they currently approach their jobs. Consider various user goals for the RMO Consolidated Sales and \n\u00ad\nMarketing System (CSMS) introduced in Chapter 2.", "domains": ["Design Principles", "Software Quality Attributes"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "74: PART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\n4. Interview each type of user to determine the specific goals they will have \nwhen using the new system. Start with goals they currently have and then \nget them to imagine innovative functions they think would add value. Encourage them to state each goal in the imperative verb-noun form, such \nas Add customer, Update order, and Produce month-end report. 5. Create a list of preliminary use cases organized by type of user. 6. Look for duplicates with similar use case names and resolve inconsistencies. 7. Identify where different types of users need the same use cases. 8.\t Review the completed list with each type of user and then with interested \nstakeholders. \u25a0\n\u25a0Use Cases and Event Decomposition\nThe most comprehensive technique for identifying use cases is the event decom-\nposition technique. The event decomposition technique begins by identify-\ning all the business events the information system responds to, with each event \nleading to a use case. Starting with business events helps the analyst define each \nuse case at the appropriate level of detail. For example, one analyst might iden-\ntify a use case as typing in a customer name on a form. A second analyst might \nidentify a use case as the entire process of adding a new customer. A third ana-\nlyst might even define a use case as working with customers all day, which could \ninclude adding new customers, updating customer records, deleting customers, \nfollowing up on late-paying customers, or contacting former customers. The \nfirst example is too narrow to be useful. Conversely, working with customers all \nday\u2014the third example\u2014is too broad to be useful. The second example defines \na complete user goal, which is the right level of analysis for a use case. The appropriate level of detail for identifying use cases is one that focuses on \nelementary business processes (EBPs). An EBP is a task that is performed \nby one person in one place in response to a business event, adds measurable \nbusiness value, and leaves the system and its data in a stable and consistent state.

For example, in process \ncontrol, if a vat of chemicals is full, then the system needs to Turn off the fill \nvalve. The relevant event is \u201cvat is full,\u201d and the system needs to respond to that \nevent immediately. In an airplane guidance system, if the plane\u2019s altitude drops \nbelow 5,000 feet, then the system needs to Turn on the low-altitude alarm. Most information systems now being developed are so interactive that \nthey can be thought of as real-time systems. In fact, people expect a real-time \nresponse to almost everything. Thus, use cases for business systems are often \nidentified by using the event decomposition technique. \u25a0\n\u25a0Types of Events\nThere are three types of events to consider when using the event decomposi-\ntion technique to identify use cases: external events, temporal events, and state \nevents (also called internal events). The analyst begins by trying to identify \nand list as many of these events as possible, refining the list while talking with \n\u00ad\nsystem users. \u275a\n\u275aExternal Events\nAn external event is an event that occurs outside the system\u2014usually initiated \nby an external agent or actor. An external agent (or actor) is a person or orga-\nnizational unit that supplies or receives data from the system. To identify the \nkey external events, the analyst first tries to identify all the external agents that \nmight want something from the system. A classic example of an external agent is \na customer. The customer may want to place an order for one or more products. This event is of fundamental importance to an order-processing system, such as \nthe one needed by Ridgeline Mountain Outfitters. But other events are associ-\nated with a customer. Sometimes, a customer wants to return an ordered prod-\nuct, or a customer needs to pay the invoice for an order. External events such as \nthese define what the system needs to be able to do. They are events that lead to \nimportant transactions that the system must process. When describing external events, it is important to name the event so the \nexternal agent is clearly defined. The description should also include the action \nthat the external agent wants to pursue.", "domains": ["Design Patterns"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W. Satzinger, Robert B.

{"text": "77: CHAPTER 3 \u25a0 Identifying User Stories and Use Cases\n\u275a\n\u275aTemporal Events\nA second type of event is a temporal event\u2014an event that occurs as a result \nof reaching a point in time. Many information systems produce outputs at \ndefined intervals, such as payroll systems that produce a paycheck every two \nweeks (or each month). Sometimes, the outputs are reports that management \nwants to receive regularly, such as monthly or weekly performance or excep-\ntion reports. These events are different from external events in that the system \nshould automatically produce the required output without being told to do so. In other words, no external agent or actor is making demands, but the system is \nsupposed to generate information or other outputs when they are needed. The analyst begins identifying temporal events by asking about specific \ndeadlines that the system must accommodate. What outputs are produced at \nthat deadline? What other processing might be required at that deadline? In a \npayroll system, a temporal event might be named \u201cTime to produce biweekly \npayroll.\u201d The event defining the need for a monthly summary report might be \nnamed \u201cTime to produce monthly sales summary report.\u201d Figure 3-5 provides \na checklist to use in identifying temporal events. Temporal events do not have to occur on a fixed date. They can occur after \na defined period of time has elapsed. For example, a bill might be given to a cus-\ntomer when a sale has occurred. If the bill has not been paid within 15 days, the \nsystem might send a late notice. The temporal event \u201cTime to send late notice\u201d \nmight be defined as a point 15 days after the billing date. \u275a\n\u275aState Events\nA third type of event is a state event\u2014an event that occurs when something hap-\npens inside the system that triggers the need for processing. State events are also \ncalled internal events. For example, if the sale of a product results in an adjustment \nto an inventory record, and the inventory in stock drops below a reorder point, it \nis necessary to reorder. The state event might be named \u201cReorder point reached.\u201d \nOften, state events occur as a consequence of external events.

Consider a customer buying a \nshirt from a retail store (see Figure 3-6). From the customer\u2019s perspective, this \npurchase involves a long sequence of events. The first event might be that the \ncustomer wants to get dressed. Then, the customer wants to wear a striped shirt. Next, the striped shirt appears to be worn out.

The analyst has to think \nthrough such a sequence to arrive at the point where an event directly affects the \nsystem. In this case, the system is not affected until the customer is in the store, \nhas a shirt in hand ready to purchase, and says \u201cI want to buy this shirt.\u201d\nIn other situations, it is not easy to distinguish between an external event \nand the system\u2019s response. For example, when the customer buys the shirt, the \nsystem requests a credit card number and then the customer supplies the credit \ncard. Is the act of supplying the credit card an event? In this case, no; it is part of \nthe interaction that occurs while completing the original transaction. The way to determine whether an occurrence is an event or whether it is \npart of the interaction following the event is by asking if any long pauses or \nintervals occur (i.e., can the system transaction be completed without interrup-\ntion?). Or\u00a0is the system at rest again, waiting for the next transaction? After the \ncustomer wants to buy the shirt (the event), the process continues until the trans-\naction is complete. There are no significant stops after the transaction begins. After the transaction is complete, the system is at rest, waiting for the next \ntransaction to begin. The EBP concept defined earlier describes this as leaving \nthe system and its data in a consistent state. On the other hand, separate events occur when the customer buys the shirt by \nusing his store credit card account. When the customer pays the bill at the end of \nthe month, is the processing part of the interaction involving the purchase? In\u00a0this \ncase, no; the system records the transaction and then does other things. It\u00a0does not \nhalt all processes to wait for the payment. A separate event occurs later that results \nin sending the customer a bill. (This is a temporal event: \u201cTime to send monthly \nbills.\u201d) Eventually, another external event occurs \u00ad\n(\u201cCustomer pays the bill\u201d). \u275a\n\u275aThe Sequence of Events: Tracing a Transaction\u2019s Life Cycle\nA useful method for identifying events is to trace the sequence of events that \nmight occur for a specific external agent or actor.", "domains": ["Design Patterns"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

Perhaps the customer has moved and wants an address change \nrecorded for future catalog mailings. Finally, the customer might want to return \nan item. Thinking through this type of sequence can help identify events. \u275a\n\u275aTechnology-Dependent Events and System Controls\nSometimes, the analyst is concerned about events that are important to the sys-\ntem, but do not directly concern users or transactions. Such events typically \ninvolve design choices or system controls. During analysis, the analyst should \ntemporarily ignore these events. However, they are important later for design. Some examples of events that affect design issues include external events \nthat refer to the physical system, such as logging on. Although important to the \nfinal operation of the system, such implementation details should be deferred. At this stage, the analyst should focus only on the functional requirements (i.e., \nthe work that the system needs to complete). A functional requirements model \ndoes not need to indicate how the system is actually implemented, so the model \nshould omit the implementation details. Most of these physical system events involve system controls, which are \nchecks or safety procedures put in place to protect the integrity of the system. For \nexample, logging on to a system is required because of system security controls. Other controls protect the integrity of the database, such as backing up the data \nevery day. These controls are important to the system, and they will certainly be \nadded to the system during design. But spending time on system controls during \nanalysis only adds details to the requirements model that users are not typically \nvery concerned about; they trust the system developers to take care of such details. One way to help decide which events apply to system controls is to assume \nthat technology is perfect. The perfect technology assumption states that \nevents should be included during analysis only if the system would be required \nto respond under perfect conditions (i.e., with equipment never breaking down, \ncapacity for processing and storage being unlimited, and people operating the \nsystem being completely honest and never making mistakes). By pretending that \ntechnology is perfect, analysts can eliminate events like \u201cTime to back up the \ndatabase\u201d because they can assume that the disk will never crash.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Software Quality Attributes"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

Consider the external events in the system environment that require a \n\u00ad\nresponse from the system by using the checklist shown in Figure 3-4. 2. For each external event, identify and name the use case that the system \nrequires. 3. Consider the temporal events that require a response from the system by \nusing the checklist shown in Figure 3-5. 4. For each temporal event, identify and name the use case that the system \nrequires and then establish the point of time that will trigger the use case. 5. Consider the state events that the system might respond to, particularly  \nif it is a real-time system in which devices or internal state changes trigger \nuse cases. 6. For each state event, identify and name the use case that the system requires \nand then define the state change. 7. When events and use cases are defined, check to see if they are required as \npart of analysis by using the perfect technology assumption.

Use cases are very similar to user stories, \nbut they are often modeled in more detail than user \nstories and are the responsibility of the developers.

Then, users are asked to list specific \nuser goals they have when using the system to support \ntheir work.

{"text": "90: PART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nThe State Patrol Ticket-Processing \nSystem\nThe purpose of the State Patrol ticket-processing system is \nto record moving violations, keep records of the fines paid by \ndrivers when they plead guilty or are found guilty of moving \nviolations, and notify the court that a warrant for arrest should \nbe issued when such fines are not paid in a timely manner. A separate State Patrol system records accidents and the \nverification of financial responsibility (insurance). But a third \nsystem uses ticket and accident records to produce driving \nrecord reports for insurance companies. Finally, a fourth sys-\ntem issues, renews, or suspends driver\u2019s licenses. These \nfour systems are obviously integrated, in that they share ac-\ncess to the same database; otherwise, they are operated \nseparately by different departments of the State Patrol. When an officer gives a ticket to a driver, a copy of \nthe ticket is turned in and entered into the system. A new \nticket record is created, and relationships to the correct \ndriver, officer, and court are established in the database. If the driver pleads guilty, he or she mails in the fine in a \npreprinted envelope with the ticket number on it. In some \ncases, the driver claims innocence and wants a court date. When the envelope is returned without a check and the trial \nrequest box has an \u201cX\u201d in it, the system does the following: \nnotes the plea on the ticket record; looks up driver, ticket, \nand officer information; and sends a ticket details report \nto the appropriate court. A trial date questionnaire form is \nalso produced at the same time and is mailed to the driver. The instructions on the questionnaire tell the driver to fill in \nconvenient dates and mail the questionnaire directly to the \ncourt. Upon receiving this information, the court schedules \na trial date and notifies the driver of the date and time. When the trial is completed, the court sends the \nverdict to the ticketing system. The verdict and trial date \nare recorded for the ticket. If the verdict is innocent, the \nsystem that produces driving record reports for insurance \ncompanies will ignore the ticket.

Because there cannot be more \nthan one customer for each order, one is also the maximum multiplicity. Some-\ntimes, such an association is read as an order must be placed by one and only \none customer. The associations described here are between two different types of things\u2014\nfor example, a customer and an order. These are called binary associations. Sometimes, an association is between two things of the same type\u2014for example, \nthe association is married to, which is between two people. This type of asso-\nciation is called a unary association (and sometimes called a recursive asso-\nciation). Another example of a unary association is an organizational hierarchy \nin which one organizational unit reports to another organizational unit\u2014the \nPacking Department reports to Shipping, which reports to Distribution, which \nreports to Marketing. An association can also be among three different types of things, when it \nis called a ternary association, or among any number of different types of \nthings, when it is called an n-ary association.

The brainstorming technique and noun \ntechnique described earlier are used in the same way with data entities as with \ndomain classes used for UML modeling. A model commonly used by traditional \nanalysts and database analysts is called the entity-relationship diagram (ERD).

But other symbols \non the relationship line also represent the minimum and maximum cardinality \nconstraints. See Figure 4-7 for an explanation of ERD relationship symbols. The model in Figure 4-6 actually says that a Customer places a minimum of \nzero Orders and a maximum of many Orders. Reading in the other direction, \nthe model says an Order is placed by at least one and only one Customer. Cardinality constraints reflect the business policies defined by management. The analyst does not decide that two customers cannot share one order. Rather, \nthe analyst must discover the underlying policy and accurately represent it using \ncardinality constraints. The analyst must be very careful not to invent policies \nby defining arbitrary cardinality constraints. When the discovery process raises \npolicy questions that haven\u2019t yet been answered\u2014the analyst must raise the \nquestion with management and let it decide on an appropriate policy. Figure 4-8 shows the model expanded to include the order items (one or \nmore specific items included on the order). Each order contains a minimum of \none and a maximum of many items (there could not be an order if it did not \ncontain at least one item). For example, an order might include a shirt, a pair of \nshoes, and a belt, and each of these items is associated with the order.

{"text": "103: CHAPTER 4 \u25a0 Domain Modeling\nLook again at the cardinality. Note that a customer must have at least \none account. The rationale for this is that the bank would not add a customer \nunless he or she was adding an account. Note also that the branch can have zero \naccounts. A branch might be added long before it opens its doors, so it is possible \nthat it is does not have any accounts. Additionally, there might be some branches \nthat do not have accounts, such as a kiosk at a university or airport. Note that \nan account must have at least one transaction. The rationale is that opening a \nnew account requires an initial deposit, which is a transaction. It is important to \nrecognize that questions about the cardinality and minimum and maximum car-\ndinality constraints need to be discussed and reviewed with stakeholders. \u25a0\n\u25a0The Domain Model Class Diagram\nAs discussed previously, many current approaches to system development use \nthe term domain class rather than data entity and use concepts and notations \nbased on UML to model the things in the problem domain. These concepts come \nfrom the object-oriented approach to system development. A class is a category \nor classification used to describe a collection of objects. Each object belongs to \na class. Therefore, students Mary, Joe, and Maria belong to the class Student. Classes that describe things in the problem domain are called domain classes. Domain classes have attributes and associations. Multiplicity (called cardinality \nin an ERD) applies among classes. Initially, when defining requirements, the \napproach to modeling is very similar whether the analyst is using ERD or UML \ndiagrams. The UML class diagram is used to show classes of objects for a system. One type of UML class diagram that shows the things in the users\u2019 problem \ndomain is called the domain model class diagram. Another type of UML \nclass diagram is called the design class diagram, and it is used when designing \nsoftware classes. You will learn about the design class diagram in Chapter 12. On a class diagram, rectangles represent classes, and the lines connecting \nthe rectangles show the associations among classes. Figure 4-11 shows such a \nsymbol for a single domain class: Customer. The domain class symbol is a rect-\nangle with two sections. The top section contains the name of the class, and \nthe bottom section lists the attributes of the class.", "domains": ["Domain-Driven Design"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "103: The domain class symbol is a rect-\nangle with two sections. The top section contains the name of the class, and \nthe bottom section lists the attributes of the class. Later, you will learn that the \ndesign class symbol includes a third section at the bottom for listing methods of \nthe class; methods do not apply to problem domain classes. Class names and attribute names use camelback (sometimes called \ncamelcase) notation, in which the words run together without a space or under-\nscore. Class names begin with a capital letter; attribute names begin with a low-\nercase letter (see Figure 4-11). Class diagrams are drawn by showing classes and \nassociations among classes. The examples used previously for the entity-relation-\nship diagram are redrawn by using UML domain class diagram notation in the fol-\nlowing section so you can compare them.

Each subclass has its own special attributes that \ndo not apply to the other subclasses. A SavingsAccount has four attributes, and \na CheckingAccount has five attributes. Note that each subclass also inherits an \nassociation with a Customer, optionally a Branch, and one or more Transactions. \u275a\n\u275aWhole-Part Relationships\nAnother way that people structure information about things is by defining them \nin terms of their parts. For example, learning about a computer system might \ninvolve recognizing that the computer is actually a collection of parts: processor, \nmain memory, keyboard, disk storage, and monitor. A keyboard is not a special \ntype of computer; it is part of a computer, but it is also something separate. Whole-part relationships are used to show an association between one class \nand other classes that are parts of that class. There are two types of whole-part relationships: aggregation and compo-\nsition. Aggregation refers to a type of whole-part relationship between the \naggregate (whole) and its components (parts), where the parts can exist sepa-\nrately. Figure 4-22 demonstrates the concept of aggregation in a computer sys-\ntem, with the UML diamond symbol representing aggregation. Composition \nrefers to whole-part relationships that are even stronger, where the parts, once \nassociated, can no longer exist separately. The UML diamond symbol is filled in \nsolid to represent composition. For example, think of a house that is made up \nof bathrooms, bedrooms, stairwell, and so forth.

As with \nany association relationship, multiplicity can apply, such as when a computer \nhas one or more storage devices. The UML class diagram examples you have seen so far are domain model \nclass diagrams. The design class diagram is a refinement of the class diagram \nand is used to represent software classes in the new system.

A domain model class diagram \nfor an information system evolves as the project proceeds; and unlike the use \ncase diagrams, where many diagrams are created, there is eventually only one \ndomain model class diagram. Also, unlike the use case diagram, the domain \nmodel class diagram is not produced just for presentations. The process of devel-\noping and refining the domain model class diagram is how the analyst explores \nand learns about the problem domain. Therefore, the information depicted in \nthe domain model class diagram is very detailed and rich in specific meaning. The Ridgeline Mountain Outfitters domain model class diagram is a varia-\ntion of the customer, order, and order item example shown in Figure 4-12. Most \nof the domain classes are from the list of nouns developed in Figure 4-2. Because \nthe model is fairly complex, an analyst might start by focusing on one subsystem \nat a time to reduce the complexity. Eventually, all subsystems can be combined \ninto one domain model. \u275a\n\u275aThe RMO Sales Subsystem\nFigure 4-23 shows a domain model class diagram for the RMO CSMS Sales \nsubsystem. The Sales subsystem mainly involves the customer, sale, sales items, \nproducts, promotions, and accessories. That is a good starting point, but there \nare also additional domain classes. Additionally, recall that the association rela-\ntionships are just as important as the classes, so these must be identified. There \nare also special types of sales and a shopping cart.

Repeat-\ning domain classes in several subsystems does not mean there is redundancy. In \ncomplex domain models, it is easier to do the modeling and analysis in separate \ndiagrams before merging them all together. Sometimes, the project team divides \nthe work by subsystem, so each would work on a separate diagram being sure to \ncoordinate with each other. The Customer Account subsystem includes messages, partner credits, and \nfriend links. The FriendLink class is an association class, but unlike other exam-\nples, it is attached to a unary association between customers. Each customer can \nbe linked to many other customers, shown by the association line at the top of the \nCustomer class. For each link, the status and dateLinkedUp is stored. The Mes-\nsage class is handled differently. Each customer can send many messages, each to \nmany other customers. Similarly, each customer can receive many messages. \u275a\n\u275aThe Complete RMO Domain Model Class Diagram\nThe analysts at RMO may continue to model each subsystem separately.

For example, a customer might want to know \nwhether a particular sale has been shipped or a manager might want to know if a \ncustomer sale has been paid for. Thus, the system needs to be able to track the sta-\ntus of customer sales. When defining requirements, analysts need to identify and \ndocument which domain objects require status checking and which business rules \ndetermine valid status conditions.

The status condition for a real-world object is often referred to as the state \nof the object. Defined precisely, a state of an object is a condition that occurs \nduring its life when it satisfies some criterion, performs some action, or waits for \nan event. For real-world objects, we mean the same thing whether we refer to \nthe status condition of an object or talk about its state. The naming convention for status conditions helps identify valid states. A\u00a0state might have a name of a simple condition, such as On or In repair. Other \nstates are more active, with names consisting of gerunds or verb phrases, such as \nBeing shipped or Working. For example, a specific Sale object comes into exis-\ntence when a customer buys something. Right after it is created, the object might \nbe in a state called Adding new sale items, then a state called Waiting for items \nto be shipped, and finally, when all items have been shipped, a state called Com-\npleted. If you find yourself trying to use a noun to name a state, you probably have \nan incorrect idea about states or object classes. The name of a state should not be \na noun (which is an object); it should be something that describes the object. States are described as semipermanent conditions because external events \ncan interrupt a state and cause the object to go to a new state. An object remains \nin a state until some event causes it to move, or transition, to another state. A\u00a0transition, then, is the movement of an object from one state to another state.

The combination of states and transi-\ntions between states provides the mechanisms that analysts use to capture busi-\nness rules. In the previous RMO example, you would say that a customer sale \nmust be in a Paid for state before it can transition to a Shipped state. The UML diagram that is used to describe the behavior of an object is \ncalled a state machine diagram. Sometimes these diagrams are also called \nstate-transition diagrams because they describe the states and the transitions of \nthe object. This section introduces state machines. A state machine diagram describes the behavior, or the possible behav-\nior, of the objects in one particular object class. This is an important concept \nto \u00ad\nunderstand\u2014that a state machine diagram applies to only one single class, \nand that it can be used to describe the behavior of all objects within that class. \u00ad\nEarlier in the chapter, you learned how to create a UML class diagram. A class \ndiagram describes the static characteristics of objects and their associations. A\u00a0state machine describes the dynamic behavior of objects. A state machine diagram can be developed for any problem domain classes \nthat have complex behavior or status conditions that need to be tracked. How-\never, not all classes will require a state machine diagram. If an object in the \nproblem domain class doesn\u2019t have status conditions that must control the \nprocessing for that object, a state machine diagram probably is not necessary. For example, in the RMO class diagram, a class such as Sale may need a state \nmachine diagram. However, a class such as SaleTransaction probably does not. A sale transaction is created when the payment is made and then just sits there; \nit doesn\u2019t need to track other conditions. A state machine diagram is composed of rounded rectangles representing the \nstates of an object and arrows representing the transitions. Figure 4-26 illus-\ntrates a simple state machine diagram for a printer.

{"text": "117: CHAPTER 4 \u25a0 Domain Modeling\nThe transition label consists of the following syntax with three components:\ntransition-name (parameters, \u2026) [guard-condition] / action-expression\nIn Figure 4-26, the transition-name is onButtonPushed. The transition is like \na trigger that fires or an event that occurs. The name should reflect the action of \na triggering event. In Figure 4-26, no parameters are being sent to the printer so \nthe parentheses are left off. The guard-condition is [Safety cover closed]. For the \ntransition to fire, the guard must be true. The forward slash divides the firing \nmechanism from the actions or processes. Action-\u00ad\nexpressions indicate some \nprocess that must occur before the transition is completed and the object arrives \nin the destination state. In this case, the printer will run a start-up procedure \nbefore it goes into the On state. The guard-condition is a qualifier or test on the transition, and it is simply \na true/false condition that must be satisfied before the transition can fire. For a \ntransition to fire, first the trigger must occur and then the guard must evaluate \nto true. Sometimes, a transition has only a guard-condition and no triggering \nevent. In that case, the trigger is considered to be constantly firing, and when-\never the guard becomes true, the transition occurs. Any of the three components\u2014transition-name, guard-condition, or action-\nexpression\u2014may be empty. If either the transition-name or the guard-condition \nis empty, it automatically evaluates to true. Either of them may also be complex, \nwith AND and OR connectives. \u25a0\n\u25a0Concurrency and Concurrent States\nSometimes an object will be in two states at the same time. For example, when \nthe printer is in the On state, it can also be either Printing or Idle. There are sev-\neral ways to express this concurrent condition. This section explains the basic \napproach to modeling concurrent behavior. There are more sophisticated tech-\nniques that are available; however, the basic approach is usually sufficient for \nbusiness modeling. This condition of being in more than one state at a time is called \u00ad\nconcurrency, \nor concurrent states. For example, the printer can be in the On state and the \nIdle state at the same time. Hence, On and Idle would be concurrent states. Another concept that is important is the idea of a path for the object. A path \nis a sequential set of connected states and transitions.

{"text": "118: PART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nThe notation used in Figure 4-27 is similar to the notation that you used \nwith activity diagrams in Chapter 2. When a state has two transitions that exit \nthat state, it is considered an OR condition. In other words, the path for the \nobject follows only one of the transitions. To show parallel paths with the object \nfollowing both paths, that is, an AND condition, a synchronization bar is used. In Figure 4-27, the path with the Idle and Printing states is parallel with the \npath with the On state. In other words, the printer will be in either the Idle or \nPrinting states whenever it is in the On state. Notice that the printRequest (doc) \ntransition does have an argument being sent with the transition. The printer will \ncycle between the Idle state and the Printing state whenever it is in the On state. When the offButtonPushed transition fires, the printer exits both the On state \nand either the Idle or Printing state, whichever is active. Now that you know the \nbasic notation of state machine diagrams, you will learn how to develop a state \nmachine diagram. \u25a0\n\u25a0Rules for Developing State Machine Diagrams\nState machine diagram development follows a set of rules. Usually, the primary \nchallenge in building a state machine diagram is to identify the right states for \nthe object. It might be helpful to pretend that you are the object itself. It is easy to \npretend to be a customer, but it\u2019s a little more difficult to say \u201cI am an order\u201d or \u201cI \nam a shipment. How do I come into existence? What states am I in?\u201d However, if \nyou can begin to think this way, it will help you develop state machine diagrams. A good approach is to remember that developing state machine diagrams is \nan iterative behavior\u2014more so than developing any other type of diagram. Ana-\nlysts seldom get a state machine diagram right the first time. They always draw \nit and then refine it again and again. Finally, don\u2019t forget to ask about an exception condition\u2014especially when \nyou see the words verify or check. Usually, there will be two transitions out of \nstates that verify something: one for acceptance and one for rejection.", "domains": ["Design Patterns"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "118: Finally, don\u2019t forget to ask about an exception condition\u2014especially when \nyou see the words verify or check. Usually, there will be two transitions out of \nstates that verify something: one for acceptance and one for rejection. Here is a list of steps that will help you get started in developing state \nmachine diagrams:\n1.\t Review the class diagram and select the classes that might require state \nmachine diagrams. Only include those classes that have multiple status \nconditions that are important for the system to track. Then, begin with the \nclasses that appear to have the simplest state machine diagrams, such as the \nSaleItem class for RMO. 2. For each selected class in the group, make a list of all the status condi-\ntions you can identify. At this point, simply brainstorm. Remember that \nthese states must reflect the states for the real-world objects that will be \nrepresented in software. Sometimes, it is helpful to think of the physical \nobject, identify states of the physical object, and then translate those that \nare appropriate into corresponding system states or status conditions. It \nis also helpful to think of the life of the object. Think of activities done to \nthe object or by the object. Often, the object will be in a particular state as \nthese actions are occurring. 3. Begin building state machine diagram fragments by identifying the transi-\ntions that cause an object to leave the identified state. For example, if a sale \nis in a state of Ready to be shipped, a transition such as beginShipping will \ncause the sale to leave that state. 4. Sequence these state-transition fragments in the correct order. Then, aggre-\ngate these combinations into larger fragments. As the fragments are being \naggregated into larger paths, it is natural to begin to look for a natural life \ncycle for the object. 5.\t Review the paths and look for independent, concurrent paths. When an \nitem can be in two states concurrently, there are probably one or more \nconcurrent paths. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "119: CHAPTER 4 \u25a0 Domain Modeling\n6. Look for additional transitions. Often, during a first iteration, several of the \npossible combinations of state-transition-state are missed. One method to \nidentify them is to take every paired combination of states and ask whether \nthere is a valid transition between the states. Test for transitions in both directions. 7. Expand each transition with the appropriate message event, guard-\ncondition, and action-expression. Include with each state appropriate \naction-expressions. 8.\t Review and test each state machine diagram. Review each of your state \nmachine diagrams to make sure the names of the states describe the object\u2019s \nstatus condition, to make sure you have identified all the transitions, to check \nfor all concurrent paths, and to ensure you have the exception conditions. \u25a0\n\u25a0Developing RMO State Machine Diagrams\nLet us practice these steps by developing two state machine diagrams for RMO. The first step is to review the domain class diagram and then select the classes \nthat may have status conditions that need to be tracked. In this case, we select \nthe SaleItem and the InventoryItem classes. Other classes that are candidates for \nstate machine diagrams are: Sale, to track when it is completed; Shipment, to \ntrack arrivals at the customer location; and possibly Customer, to track active \nand inactive customers. \u275a\n\u275aDeveloping the SaleItem State Machine Diagram\nThe first step in developing the SaleItem state machine diagram is to identify the \npossible status conditions that might be of interest. Some necessary status condi-\ntions are Ready to be shipped, On back order, and Shipped. An interesting ques-\ntion comes to mind at this point: Can a sale item be partially shipped? In other \nwords, if the customer bought 10 of a single item but there are only five in inven-\ntory, should RMO ship those five and put the other five on back order? You \nshould see the ramifications of this decision. The system and the database would \nneed to be designed to track and monitor detailed information to support this \ncapability. The domain class diagram for RMO indicates that a SaleItem can be \nassociated with either zero (not yet shipped) shipments or one (totally shipped) \nshipment. Based on the current specification, the definition doesn\u2019t allow partial \nshipments of SaleItems. This is just another example of the benefit of building models.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Domain-Driven Design"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W. Satzinger, Robert B.

Had we not \nbeen developing the state machine diagram model, this question might never \nhave been asked. The development of detailed models and diagrams is one of the \nmost important activities that a system developer can perform. It forces analysts \nto ask fundamental questions. Sometimes, new system developers think that \nmodel development is a waste of time, especially for small systems. However, \ntruly understanding the users\u2019 needs before writing the program always saves \ntime in the long run. The second step is to identify exit transitions for each of the status conditions.

{"text": "120: PART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nThe third step is to combine the state-transition pairs into fragments \nand to build a state machine diagram with the states in the correct sequence. Figure 4-29 illustrates the partially completed state machine diagram. The flow \nfrom beginning to end for the SaleItem object is quite obvious. However, at least \none transition seems to be missing. There should be some path to allow entry \ninto the On back order state so we recognize that this first-cut state machine \ndiagram needs some refinement. We will fix that in a moment. The fourth step is to look for concurrent paths. In this case, it doesn\u2019t appear \nthat a SaleItem object can be in any two of the identified states at the same time. Of course, because we chose to begin with a simple state machine diagram, that \nwas expected. The fifth step is to look for additional transitions. This step is where we \nflesh out other necessary transitions. The first addition is to have a transition \nfrom Open to On back order. To continue, examine every pair of states to see \nwhether there are other possible combinations. In particular, look for backward \ntransitions. In this situation, we will not define any backward transitions. The sixth step is to complete all the transitions with correct names, guard-\nconditions, and action-expressions. Two new transition-names are added. The \nfirst is the transition from the beginning black dot to the Open state. That \ntransition causes the creation\u2014or, in system terms, the instantiation\u2014of a new \nSaleItem object. It is given the same name as the message into the system that \nadds it: addItem. The final transition is the one that causes the order item to \nbe removed from the system. This transition goes from the Shipped state to a \nfinal circled black dot, which is a final pseudostate. On the assumption that \nit is archived to a backup tape when it is deleted from the active system, that \ntransition is named archive.

{"text": "121: CHAPTER 4 \u25a0 Domain Modeling\n\u275a\n\u275aDeveloping the InventoryItem State Machine Diagram\nAn InventoryItem will have a slightly more complex state machine. In this exam-\nple, you will discover the need to have some concurrent paths defined. As before, \nstart by thinking of the various status conditions that are important and their asso-\nciated end or exit conditions. As you think about an inventory item, recognize that \nimportant status conditions are associated with the level of inventory. An item can \nbe at a normal inventory level, a low inventory level, or completely out of stock. In \naddition, an inventory item can be on order or have an order outstanding. It could \nalso not have any orders outstanding. As you think about it, notice that it appears \nthese two sets of status are independent of each other. First, identify all of these \nstates and their exit transitions. Figure 4-31 documents our thinking. In the third and fourth steps, you combine these states and transitions into \nfragments and connect them together to give the first-cut state machine dia-\ngram. In the fifth step, you see if these state-transition fragments are really con-\ncurrent paths. In this situation, there are two concurrent paths. Figure 4-32 \nshows these steps. There are a few things you need to consider with this first-cut state machine. Let\u2019s look at the various transitions and consider each transition along with its \norigin state and destination state. The top path appears to be okay\u2014cycling \nbetween Not on order and On order. In the bottom path, however, there are \ntransitions that have the same name. How do you ensure that the correct transi-\ntions fire and the correct states are used? First consider the reduceInventory transition. The InventoryItem will \nreceive this message every time an item is sold. However, it only wants to take \nthe transition from one state to another if it is at the reorder point, or if it is the \nlast item in stock. Let\u2019s add guards to define those conditions. You also want to \ninitiate a reorder process when the InventoryItem goes to a Low stock or a Zero \nstock state. Let\u2019s add those action expressions. Next consider the restock transition. It is correct. Depending on what state \nthe InventoryItem is in, the correct transition will fire and move to the Normal \nstock state.", "domains": ["Design Patterns"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

UML and the domain model \nclass diagram can be extended to include three types of \nrelationships: association relationships, generalization/\nspecialization relationships (inheritance), and whole-\npart relationships. Additional concepts of importance \nin domain model class diagrams are superclasses, \nsubclasses, abstract classes, and concrete classes. The \nbehavior of problem domain objects is an aspect of \nfunctional requirements that is also studied and mod-\neled. Over time, an object will transition from one state \nto another. The UML state machine diagram is used to \nmodel object states and state transitions. Only complex \ndomain classes with numerous states and state transi-\ntions will warrant a state machine diagram. Up to this \npoint, when we talk about domain classes, they are \nconceptual things that users work with; they are not \nsoftware classes.

At first, Bill received requests for package \npickups on his mobile phone, recorded that informa-\ntion in a log, and would then drive around to retrieve \nall the packages later in the day. However, he soon \ndiscovered that with another driver, it was difficult \nto coordinate pickups between the two of them from \nhis van. It was not long before he reorganized his \nbusiness and turned the warehouse employee into a \ndriver. Then, he stayed in the warehouse himself, and \nhis two employees made all the pickups and deliver-\nies. This worked well because he could control and \ncoordinate the pickups and deliveries better. It was \nalso easier for him to receive pickup requests working \nat a desk rather than trying to do it while driving a \ndelivery van. As he thought about how his business was grow-\ning and the services he provided to his customers, Bill \nbegan to itemize the kinds of information he would \nneed to maintain. Of course, he needed to maintain information \nabout his customers. Some of his customers were \nbusinesses; some were individuals. He needed to have \nbasic address and contact information for every cus-\ntomer. Also, for his corporate customers, he needed to \nidentify a primary contact person. It was mostly his \ncorporate customers who wanted to receive monthly \nstatements listing all their shipments during the month \nand the total cost. Bill needed to distinguish which \ncustomers paid cash and which wanted monthly state-\nments. In fact, for those who paid monthly, he needed \nto keep a running account of such things as when they \nwere last billed, when they paid, and any outstanding \nbalances. Finally, when payments were received, either \nfor individual shipments or from monthly invoices, \nhe needed to record information about the payment: \ntype of payment, date, and amount. Although this was \nnot a sophisticated billing and payment system, Bill \nthought it would suffice for his needs. Next, he started thinking about his packages and \nshipments.

He \nalso recorded the date and time that he received the \norder. A delivery order was considered \u201copen\u201d until \nthe delivery van arrived at the pickup location and the \npackages were all retrieved. At that point, the delivery \norder was satisfied.

Other important information was \nthe \u201cdeliver to\u201d entity name and the address. He also \nneeded to identify the type of delivery. Some pack-\nages were high priority, requiring same-day delivery. Others were overnight. Of course, the weight and cost \nwere recorded so the customer could either pay or have \nit added to the monthly invoice. In the courier and delivery business, one of the \nmost important information requirements is the date \nand time stamp.

The object-oriented models track \nvery closely with the new object-oriented programming \nlanguages and frameworks.\u201d\nWilliam is just getting warmed up. \u201cThis way of thinking about a system in terms of \nobjects is very interesting,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is also consis-\ntent with the object-oriented programming techniques \nyou learned in your programming classes. You prob-\nably first learned to think about objects when you de-\nveloped screens for the user interface. All the controls \non the screen, such as buttons, text boxes, and drop-\ndown boxes, are objects. Each has its own set of trigger \nevents that activate its program functions.\u201d\n\u201cHow does this apply to our situation?\u201d one of the \nanalysts asks. \u201cYou just extend that thought process,\u201d William \nexplains.\u201d You think of such things as purchase orders \nand employees as objects, too. We can call them the \nproblem domain objects to differentiate them from user-\ninterface objects, such as windows and buttons. During \nanalysis, we have to find out all the trigger events and \nmethods associated with each business object.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how do we do that?\u201d another analyst asks. \u201cYou continue with your fact-finding activities and \nbuild a better understanding of each use case,\u201d William \nsays. \u201cThe way the problem domain objects interact \nwith each other in the use case determines how you \nidentify the initiating activity. We refer to those activi-\nties as the messages between objects. The tricky part \nis that you need to think in terms of objects instead of \njust processes. Sometimes, it helps me to pretend I am \nan object. I will say, \u2018I am a purchase order object. What \nfunctions and services are other objects going to ask me \nto do?\u2019 After you get the hang of it, it works very well, \nand it is enlightening to see how the system require-\nments unfold as you develop the diagrams.\u201d\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

An information sys-\ntem also needs to record and store information about classes of objects involved \nin the business processes. In a manual system, the information is recorded on \npaper and stored in a filing cabinet. In an automated system, the information is \nstored in electronic files or a database. The information storage requirements of \na system are documented either with entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) or, as \nemphasized in this text, with UML domain model class diagrams. In this chapter, you learn additional techniques and models that will allow \nyou to extend the requirements models to show additional information about \nthe use cases for the system. Fully developed use case descriptions, UML activ-\nity diagrams, and UML system sequence diagrams (SSDs) are introduced to \nshow more information about each use case. Additionally, the CRUD technique \nis introduced to help validate the use cases in terms of supporting all of the \ndomain classes in the domain model class diagram.

Some brief use case descriptions were shown in Chapter 3 (repeated again as \nFigure 5-1). A brief description gives enough detail for very simple use cases, \nespecially when the system to be developed is a small, well-understood applica-\ntion.

Thus, a scenario is a unique set of inter-\nnal activities within a use case and represents a unique path through the use case. In larger or more formal projects, a unique identifier can also be added for \nthe use case, with an extension identifying the particular scenario. Sometimes, \nthe name of the system developer who produced the form is added. The third compartment identifies the event that triggers the use case. The \nfourth compartment is a brief description of the use case. Analysts may just \nduplicate the brief description they constructed earlier here. The fifth compart-\nment identifies the actor or actors. Implied in all use cases is a person who uses \nthe system called an actor. Actors are shown as stick figures on use case dia-\ngrams. An actor is always outside the automation boundary of the system but \nmay be part of the manual portion of the system. By defining actors that way\u2014\nas those who interact with the automated part of the system\u2014you can more pre-\ncisely define the exact interactions to which the automated system must respond.

The eighth and ninth compartments\u2014preconditions and postconditions\u2014\nprovide critical information about the state of the system before and after the \nuse case executes. Preconditions identify what the state of the system must be \nfor the use case to begin, including what objects must already exist, what infor-\nmation must be available, and even the condition of the actor prior to beginning \nthe use case. Postconditions identify what must be true upon completion of the use \ncase. Most important, they indicate what new objects are created or updated \nby the use case and how objects need to be associated. The postconditions are \nimportant for two reasons. First, they form the basis for stating the expected \nresults for test cases that will be used for testing the use case after it is imple-\nmented. For example, in the Create customer account use case, it is important \nto test that a customer record, address record, and account record were suc-\ncessfully added to the database. Second, the objects in postconditions indicate \nwhich objects involved in the use case are important for design. You will see in \nChapters 12 and 13 that the design of a use case includes identifying and assign-\ning responsibilities to objects that collaborate to complete the use case. In this \nsituation, a customer, one or more addresses, and an account object collaborate \nto create a new customer account. The tenth compartment in the template describes the detailed flow of activi-\nties of the use case.

Activity diagrams are helpful when the flow of activities for a use case is \ncomplex. The use case Fill shopping cart is complex in that three other use \ncases might be invoked while adding items to the shopping cart. For example, \nthe actor might search for a product and then look at product reviews before \nadding the item to the cart. Once an item is added, the actor might search for \nand view available accessories and then add one or more to the cart.

As with \na use case diagram, the stick figure represents an actor\u2014a person (or role) who \ninteracts with the system. In a use case diagram, the actor \u201cuses\u201d the system, \nbut the emphasis in an SSD is on how the actor \u201cinteracts\u201d with the system by \nentering input data and receiving output data. The box labeled :System is an \nobject that represents the entire automated system. In SSDs and all other inter-\naction diagrams, analysts use object notation instead of class notation. In object \nnotation, a box refers to an individual object, not the class of all similar objects. The notation is simply a rectangle with the name of the object underlined. The \ncolon before the underlined class name is a frequently used but optional part of \nthe object notation to indicate that the object is an unnamed object of the class. In an SSD, the only object included is one representing the entire system: an \nunnamed object of the System class. Underneath the actor and :System are vertical dashed lines called lifelines. A\u00a0lifeline, or object lifeline, is simply the extension of that object\u2014either actor \nor object\u2014during the use case. The arrows between the lifelines represent the \nmessages that are sent by the actor. Each arrow has an origin and a destination. The origin of the message is the actor or object that sends it, as indicated by the \nlifeline at the arrow\u2019s tail. Similarly, the destination actor or object of a message \nis indicated by the lifeline that is touched by the arrowhead. The purpose of \nlifelines is to indicate the sequence of the messages sent and received by the actor \nand object. The sequence of messages is read from top to bottom in the diagram. A message is labeled to describe its purpose and any input data being sent. The message name should follow the verb-noun syntax to make the purpose \nclear. The syntax of the message label has several options; the simplest forms are \nshown in Figure 5-7. Remember that the arrows are used to represent a message \nand input data.

The syntax is simply the \nname of the message followed by the input parameters in parentheses. This form \nof syntax is attached to a solid line with arrow. The returned value has a slightly different format and meaning. Notice that \nthe line with arrow is dashed. A dashed arrow indicates a response or an answer \n(in programming, a return), and as shown in the figure, it immediately follows the \ninitiating message. The format of the label is also different. Because it is a response, \nonly the data that are sent on the response are noted. There is no message request-\ning a service\u2014only the data being returned. In this case, a valid response might \nbe a list of all the information returned\u2014for example, the description, price, and \nquantity of an item.

Figure 5-10\u2014the SSD for the Create \n \ncustomer account use case\u2014illustrates the three messages based on \nthe activity diagram. Notice that the names of the messages reflect the \nservices that the actor is requesting of the system: createNewCustomer, \nenterAddress, and enterCreditCard. Other names could also have  \nbeen used. For example, instead of enterAddress, the name could be \ncreateAddress. The point to remember is that the message name  \nshould describe the service requested from the system and should be  \nin verb-noun form. The other information required is the parameter list for each message. Determining exactly which data items must be passed in is more difficult. In fact, developers frequently find that determining the data parameters \nrequires several iterations before a correct, complete list is obtained. The \nimportant principle for identifying data parameters is to base it on the class \ndiagram. In other words, the appropriate attributes from the classes are \nlisted as parameters. Looking at the attributes, along with an understand-\ning of what the system needs to do, will help you find the right attributes. With the first message just mentioned\u2014createNewCustomer\u2014the param-\neters should include basic information about the customer, such as name, \nphone, and e-mail address. Note that when the system creates the cus-\ntomer, it assigns a new customerId and returns it with the other customer \ninformation. In the second message\u2014enterAddress\u2014parameters are needed to \nidentify the full address. Usually, that would include street address, city, \nstate, and zip code. The SSD simplifies the message to show \u201caddress\u201d as \nthe parameter. The third message\u2014based on the activity diagram\u2014enters the credit \ncard information. The parameter\u2014cc-info\u2014represents the account number, \nexpiration date, and security code. 3.

This is \nan iterative process, and you will probably need to refine these diagrams several \ntimes before they accurately reflect the needs of the users. Let us develop an SSD for the Ship items use case that is shown as a fully devel-\noped use case description in Figure 5-3 and as an activity diagram in Figure 5-5. Note that the actor has five numbered steps in the flow of activities, so there will \nbe five input messages in the SSD shown in  Figure 5-11: getNextSale, setShip-\nper, recordShippedItem, initiateBackorder, and getShippingLabel. No parameter is \nneeded for getNextSale because the system will automatically return the informa-\ntion for the next sale to be shipped. The shipper is selected by the actor\u2014probably \nfrom a list on the form or page\u2014so the parameter is shipperID. There is a loop frame that repeats for each sale item in the sale. Inside the \nloop frame is an alt frame that tests the whether each sale item is available to \nship. If the item can be shipped, the recordShippedItem message is sent to the \nsystem. If the item cannot be shipped because it is out of stock or perhaps dam-\naged, the initiateBackorder message is sent to the system. Finally, the getShip-\npingLabel message requires two parameters: the size of the package and the \nweight. The system uses that information, along with the shipper and address, \nto produce the shipping label and record the cost. These first sections of this chapter have explained the models that are used \nin object-oriented development to specify the processing aspects of the new \n\u00ad\nsystem.

{"text": "148: PART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Integrating Requirements Models\nThe diagrams described in this chapter allow analysts to completely specify the \nsystem functional requirements by modeling details of the use cases. Because \nyou are using an iterative approach, you would only construct the diagrams \nthat are necessary for a given iteration. A complete use case diagram would be \nimportant to get an idea of the total scope of the new system. But the supporting \ndetails included in use case descriptions, activity diagrams, and system sequence \ndiagrams need only be done for use cases in the specific iteration. Again, it is \nimportant to remember that not all use cases need to be modeled in detail. The domain model class diagram is a special case. Much like the entire use \ncase diagram, the domain model class diagram should be as complete as pos-\nsible for the entire system early in the project, as shown for RMO in Chapter\u00a04. The number of problem domain classes for the system provides an additional \nindicator of the total scope of the system. Refinement and actual implementa-\ntion of many classes will wait for later iterations, but the domain model should \nbe fairly complete. The domain model is necessary to identify all the domain \nclasses that are required in the new system. The domain model is also used to \ndesign the\u00a0database. Throughout this chapter, you have seen how the construction of a dia-\ngram depends on information provided by another diagram. You have also seen \nthat the development of a new diagram often helps refine and correct a pre-\nvious diagram. You should also have noted that the development of detailed \ndiagrams is critical to gaining a thorough understanding of the user require-\nments. \u00ad\nFigure\u00a05-14 illustrates the primary relationships among the requirements \nmodels for object-oriented development. The use case diagram and other dia-\ngrams on the left are used to capture the processes of the new system. The class \ndiagram and its dependent diagrams capture information about the classes for \nthe new system. The solid arrows represent major dependencies, and the dashed \narrows show minor dependencies.

The components of an SSD are \nthe actor\u2014the same actor identified in the use case\u2014\nand the system. The system is treated as a black box in \nthat the internal processing isn\u2019t addressed. Messages, \nwhich represent the inputs, are sent from the actor to \nthe system. Output messages are returns from the sys-\ntem to the actor. The sequence of messages is indicated \nfrom top to bottom. The CRUD technique is used to validate that all \nof the use cases have been identified that are neces-\nsary to maintain the data represented by the domain \nmodel class diagram. Use cases must be identified that \ncreate, read or report, update, and delete or archive in-\nstances of all classes. Alternatively, other systems that \nmaintain the data must be identified when integrated \nsystems share the same database. All the models dis-\ncussed in this chapter are interrelated, and informa-\ntion in one model explains information in others. The object-oriented approach to information systems \ndevelopment has a complete set of diagrams and tex-\ntual models that together document the user\u2019s needs \nand define the system requirements. These require-\nments are specified by using domain model class \ndiagrams and state machine diagrams to model the \ndomain classes and use case diagrams, use case de-\nscriptions or activity diagrams, and system sequence \ndiagrams (SSDs) to model the use cases. The internal activities of a use case are first de-\nscribed by an internal flow of activities. It is possible \nto have several different internal flows, which repre-\nsent different scenarios of the same use case. Thus, a \nuse case may have several scenarios.

The driver will be \nable to view his or her scheduled pickups and deliver-\nies for that run. (Note: This process will require a new \nuse case\u2014something the Agile development methodol-\nogy predicted would happen.) However, because the \ntrucks will maintain frequent contact with the home \noffice via telephony Internet access, the pickup/deliv-\nery schedule can be updated in real time\u2014even dur-\ning a run. Rather than maintain constant contact, Bill \ndecides that it will be sufficient if the digital device \nsynchronizes with the home office whenever a pickup \nor delivery is made. At those points in time, the route \nschedule can be updated with appropriate information. Previously, customers were able to either call On \nthe Spot and request a package pickup or visit the com-\npany\u2019s Web site to schedule a pickup. Once customers \nlogged in, they could go to a Web page that allowed \nthem to enter information about each package, includ-\ning \u201cdeliver to\u201d addresses, size and weight category \ninformation, and type of service requested. On the \nSpot provided \u201cthree hour,\u201d \u201csame day,\u201d and \u201cover-\nnight\u201d services. To facilitate customer self-service, On \nthe Spot didn\u2019t require exact weights and sizes, but \nthere were predefined size and weight categories from \nwhich the customer could choose. Once the customer entered the information for all \nthe packages, the system would calculate the cost and \nthen print mailing labels and receipts. Depending on \nthe type of service requested and the proximity of a \ndelivery truck, the system would schedule an immedi-\nate pickup or one for later that day. It would display \nthis information so the customer would immediately \nknow when to expect the pickup. Picking up packages was a fairly straightfor-\nward process. But there was some variation in what \nwould happen depending on what information was \nin the system and whether the packages were already \nlabeled. Upon arriving at the scheduled pickup loca-\ntion, the driver would have the system display any \npackage information available for this customer. If the \nsystem already had information on the packages, the \ndriver would simply verify that the correct informa-\ntion was already in the system for the packages.

Though Jim lacked prior experi-\nence in health-care services, he\u2019d been hired due to \nexcellent performance in software development proj-\nects for a variety of firms in various industries. His skills \nin designing and deploying complex mobile applications \nwere especially valuable for several projects in progress \nat NMHS, including a reimplementation of the billing and \ninsurance reimbursement system and an upgrade to the \npatient portal that enables patients to view their medical \nrecords and to interact with their primary care providers \nvia a secure messaging system. From his first week on the job, Jim was concerned \nabout security and controls within NMHS\u2019s existing sys-\ntems and those under development. Jim gained little \ntraction with senior management when he raised those \nconcerns, but they did agree to let him hire an outside \nconsultant. Consequently, he\u2019d hired Alice Watts, a \nsecurity consultant with extensive health-care-related \nexperience, to complete a thorough analysis of existing \nsystems and to make recommendations for securing the \nsystems under development. Alice\u2019s analysis had taken \nalmost a month to complete. Jim had received some \ndisturbing preliminary findings as the work progressed, \nbut he hadn\u2019t yet seen the complete report. At a meeting that included upper management, \nAlice presented her report. She began, \u201cThough I\u2019ll \ncover several security-related issues in my presenta-\ntion, I want to start by saying that there is far more good \nnews than bad about the security of your infrastructure \nand your existing systems. You have an excellent net-\nwork administrator. She\u2019s hardened your network and \nthe systems within it against malicious attacks.

For example, \nyour system for transcribing recorded notes by physi-\ncians and other service providers doesn\u2019t incorporate \nthe latest dictionary-based technology to detect data-\nentry errors.

This chapter focuses on the solution system. \u00ad\nDuring analysis, the focus is on understanding what the system should do (i.e., \nthe requirements), whereas during design, the focus is on the solution (i.e., speci-\nfying how the system will be built and what the structural components of the \nnew system will be). New developers often ask, \u201cWhen are these tasks carried out in a real \nproject?\u201d Unfortunately, there is no single answer. Many projects begin \nwith some of the design decisions having already been made, particularly \nwith regard to the deployment environment, when companies already have a \nstrong technology infrastructure in place. For other projects, the new system \nmay be the result of a new thrust for the organization, and thus the decisions \nare wide open. However, it is normal for the project team to start thinking \nabout these issues very early in development and to begin making prelimi-\nnary decisions as requirements are being defined. The topics discussed in this \nand the following chapters are solution-oriented design topics; however, you \nshouldn\u2019t try to come up with a complete solution until you understand the \nproblem. This is the first of several chapters that discuss design. This chapter briefly \ndescribes all the design activities and discusses the overarching issues of security \nand controls in more detail. Later chapters explore other design activities and \nexplain in detail the various models and techniques used for systems design. \u25a0\n\u25a0What Is Systems Design? The term design has different meanings depending on the context in which it \nis used. For example, when designing a poster or banner, the designer is pri-\nmarily concerned with the message, text, and images, including their placement \nand stylistic elements, such as fonts and colors. The designer may also consider \nmaterials, such as paper for a small poster or tough and resilient plastics for a \nlarge banner stretched across a street. A good poster or banner design captures \nthe viewer\u2019s attention, clearly communicates the intended message in a way that \nleaves a lasting impression, and produces a final product durable enough to last \nas long as needed. The entire design can typically be completed by one person in \na matter of hours or days.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Software Quality Attributes", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "160: PART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Analysis, Design, and Implementation\nChapter 1 defined the term systems design as \u201cthose system development activi-\nties that enable a person to describe in detail how the resulting information sys-\ntem will actually be implemented.\u201d That definition was preceded by a definition \nof systems analysis: \u201cthose system development activities that enable a person to \nunderstand and specify what the new system should accomplish.\u201d The sequence of \nthe definitions implies that analysis precedes design. That is, to design anything, \nyou must first understand and specify what the final product will accomplish. In the case of a banner or poster, analysis describes the message to be conveyed \nand physical aspects, such as physical size and where it will be displayed. In the \ncase of the commercial aircraft, analysis determines requirements, such as carry-\ning capacity, fuel consumption, range, maximum speed, reliability, maintenance \ncosts, longevity, and maximum construction cost. Those complex and interde-\npendent requirements drive a complex and interdependent set of design tasks. The latter part of the systems design definition, \u201cdescribe\u2026how the result-\ning information system will actually be implemented,\u201d implies a direct and \nsequential link between design and implementation. That is, designers provide \nthe plans that others follow to build the final product or system. In the case of \na banner or poster, the designer provides a full-size or reduced-scale drawing \nand a set of construction specifications, such as size, material, thickness, and \nplacement of mounting grommets. The entire design is described in a few pages. In contrast, the commercial aircraft design is described in thousands of docu-\nments and drawings that include detailed specifications for every part. In both \ncases, design results are recorded in documents and models that provide suffi-\ncient information to build the final product. Figure 6-1 summarizes aspects of design that you can glean from the poster/\nbanner and aircraft examples and apply to information systems design:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAnalysis provides the starting point for design. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nDesign provides the starting point for implementation. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nAnalysis and design document their results to coordinate the work of mul-\ntiple people and to communicate with downstream activities. \u25a0\n\u25a0Design Models\nDuring the analysis activities described in previous chapters, we created docu-\nments and models.", "domains": ["Software Quality Attributes", "Domain-Driven Design"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

Regardless of the approach, design activities begin with documents and \nmodels created during earlier analysis activities. In other words, analysis out-\nputs are design inputs. In iterative projects, analysis and design activities are often done concur-\nrently. However, the first focus of any iteration has to be identifying and specify-\ning the requirements for some part of the system (i.e., analysis); determining the \nsolutions (i.e., design) comes later. During analysis, analysts build models to represent the real world and to \nunderstand business processes and the information used in those processes. Basically, analysis involves decomposition\u2014breaking a complex problem with \ncomplicated information requirements into smaller, more understandable pieces. Analysts then organize, structure, and document the problem domain knowl-\nedge by building requirements models. Analysis and modeling require substan-\ntial user involvement to explain the requirements and to verify that the models \nare accurate. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "161: CHAPTER 6 \u25a0 Foundations for Systems Design\nDesign is also a model-building activity. Designers convert the information \ngathered during analysis\u2014the requirements models\u2014into models that represent \nthe solution system. Design is much more oriented toward technical issues, and \ntherefore requires less user involvement and more involvement by other systems \nprofessionals. The output of design activities is a set of diagrams and documents \nthat models various aspects of the solution system. The formality of a project also affects design. Formal projects usually \nrequire well-developed design documents typically reviewed in formal meet-\nings. Developers on informal projects often create their designs with notepads \nand pencils and then throw away the design once the program is coded. This \nkind of informal design (used in many Agile projects) is merely a means to an \nend, which is the actual program code. However, even in Agile development, \nthe design activities described in this chapter are still completed.

{"text": "163: CHAPTER 6 \u25a0 Foundations for Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Design Activities\nFigure 6-3 identifies the activities of systems design. This section provides a \nshort introduction to each of these design activities. In-depth explanation and \ninstruction on the specific concepts and skills for each design activity are given \nlater in the text. Systems design involves specifying in detail how a system will work when \ndeployed within a specific technology environment. Some of the details may \nhave been defined during systems analysis, but much more detail is added dur-\ning design. In addition, each part of the final solution is heavily influenced by \nthe design of all the other parts. Thus, systems design activities are usually done \nin parallel. For example, the database design influences the design of application \ncomponents, software classes and methods, and the user interface. Likewise, the \ntechnology environment drives many of the decisions for how system functions \nare distributed across application components and how those components com-\nmunicate across a network. When an iterative approach to the SDLC is used, \nmajor design decisions are made in the first or second iteration; however, many \ndecisions are revisited and refined during later iterations. To better understand these design activities, you can summarize each one \nwith a question. In fact, system developers often ask themselves these questions \nto help them stay focused on the objective of each design activity.

In later chapters, you will develop the skills necessary for \neach of these activities. \u25a0\n\u25a0Describe the Environment\nFor purposes of information systems design, the environment consists of two \nkey elements:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nExternal systems\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nTechnology architecture\nInteractions among external systems will usually have been identified and \ndescribed by analysis activities. During analysis, those descriptions show how \ninformation flows to and from external systems. To design application compo-\nnents and their embedded software classes and methods, additional information \nabout incoming and outgoing messages is needed, including:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPrecise message formats\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWeb or network addresses of sources and destinations\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCommunication protocols\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSecurity methods\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nError detection and recovery\nThe other key element, technology architecture, was defined in Chapter 2 as \nthe set of computing hardware, network hardware and topology, and system soft-\nware employed by an organization. For example, components of RMO\u2019s Consoli-\ndated Sales and Marketing System (CSMS) will be deployed on a set of computer \nservers, desktop computers, and mobile computing devices. Those devices will \ncommunicate across one or more networks employing multiple topologies and \nprotocols. Each computing device will have an operating system (OS), communi-\ncation capabilities, diverse input and output capabilities, and so forth. Additional \nsystem software, such as database management systems (DBMSs), Web server \nsoftware, and firewalls will operate on some of the computer systems. The entire \ncollection of hardware, system software, networks, and the yet-to-be-designed \napplication components will form an integrated and comprehensive solution. Because the CSMS application software must interact with all of these elements \nonce deployed, defining this environment in detail precedes other design activities. Take a closer look at Figure 6-3, and note that all of the design activity \nnames except the first begin with the word design. In contrast, the environment \nis described rather than designed. Why is this first activity different? The answer \nlies in the relative amount of control a designer has over the environment ver-\nsus the other parts of the system. In general, the designer of a single system has \nlittle or no control over the environment. For example, with the RMO CSMS, \nthe DBMS, user identity management system, and external systems (e.g., a UPS \nshipping system) are beyond the control of the designer.", "domains": ["Software Quality Attributes", "Domain-Driven Design", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "165: CHAPTER 6 \u25a0 Foundations for Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Design the Application Components\nAn application component is a well-defined unit of software that performs \none or more specific tasks. Though that definition sounds simple, it hides com-\nplex details, including the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSize/scope. A component could be small in size, like one method in a class \nor one script embedded within a Web page. Components can also be very \nlarge, like the order acceptance subsystem of an online store, a program \ncontaining thousands of lines of source code, or an entire Web site. Of \ncourse, application component size can also be between those extremes. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nProgramming languages. Programs, functions, subroutines, and procedures \nare application components defined by traditional programming languages, \nsuch as C or FORTRAN. Object-oriented programming languages, such \nas Java and C#, use classes and methods as application components. Com-\nponents written in scripting languages, such as JavaScript and PHP, are \nembedded within other application components such as Web pages. In \nshort, the names, sizes, and relationships among application components \nvary widely from one programming language and toolkit to another. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nBuild or buy? Some parts of an information system are written by an orga-\nnization\u2019s information technology (IT) development staff. Others can be \nreused from other information systems owned by the organization, pur-\nchased separately, or acquired as part of a developer\u2019s toolkit. Other com-\nponents might be deployed by an outside organization and made available \nvia a Web services interface (e.g., Google Maps or a Federal Express pack-\nage tracking service). Key decisions made when designing application components include how \nfunctions of the system will be grouped or packaged, and how they\u2019ll interact with \none another once built (or acquired) and assembled. One of the first steps in this \ndesign activity is separating the software into subsystems. Decisions are also made \nabout the database infrastructure and about the multilayer design in which the \nuser interface is separated from the business logic and database processing. The \ntechnology architecture will impact many of these design decisions. For example, \nan organization that employs Microsoft SQL Server and .NET will divide the \napplication into components that are easily developed and deployed within that \nenvironment. A different organization that employs ORACLE DBMSs and related \ntechnology architecture will define subsystems that match that environment, usu-\nally with significant differences from a .NET design and deployment.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

In essence, application component design divides the functions of the system \ninto smaller packages, each of which must be further specified in terms of soft-\nware classes and methods.

A decade ago, user-interface design was concerned primarily with sim-\nplifying the presentation of information on desktop computer monitors and \nminimizing task-related keystrokes and mouse clicks. In the modern world, \ndesigners must deal with multiple screens ranging from phones to large multi-\nmonitor displays. Multitouch screens, voice recognition, and built-in cameras \nthat follow a user\u2019s eye movements create new options and provide greater chal-\nlenges for user-interface designers.

Designing a single user interface is now the exception, not the norm. Thus, the term user interface should generally be considered plural rather than \nsingular. Designing user interfaces can be thought of as both an analysis and design \nactivity. Analysis-related aspects include understanding the user\u2019s needs; how \nthe user carries out his or her job; and the locations, devices, and physical con-\ntexts of user-system interactions. Design-related aspects include the distribution \nand packaging of related software and determining which device capabilities \nand embedded software will be incorporated into an interface.

{"text": "168: PART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nAnalysts must consider many important technical issues when designing the \ndatabase. Many of the technical (as opposed to functional) requirements defined \nduring systems analysis concern database performance needs (such as response \ntimes). Much of the design work might involve performance tuning to make sure \nthe system actually responds quickly enough. Security and encryption issues, \nwhich are important aspects of information integrity, must be addressed and \ndesigned into the solution. Given today\u2019s widespread connectivity, a database \nmay need to be replicated or partitioned at various locations around the world. It is also not uncommon to have multiple databases with distinct DBMSs. These \ndatabases may be distributed across multiple database servers and may even be \nlocated at completely different sites. These highly technical issues often require \nspecialized skills from experts in database design, security, performance, and \nphysical configuration. A final key aspect of database design is making sure \nthe new databases are properly integrated with existing databases. Chapter 9 \ndescribes database design in detail. \u25a0\n\u25a0Design the Software Classes and Methods\nDuring this design activity, analysis models, including class diagrams, system \nsequence diagrams, and state-machine diagrams, are extended to incorporate \nsoftware-specific elements. Designers also create additional models such as \nsequence diagrams. These models are blueprints for software methods that will \nbe programmed, tested, and eventually deployed. The purpose of this activity is \nto describe in enough detail how the software programs work, so that program-\nmers can write the code for the functions and methods.

Other controls and security are system-specific, and must be specifically \ndesigned by that system\u2019s developers. For example, a payroll-processing sys-\ntem typically includes significant controls to ensure that only valid employees \nor supervisors submit payroll information, that correct computations are per-\nformed on valid data inputs, and to define which data and processing results can \nbe accessed by which users. Additional controls are part of the system\u2019s data-\nbase and are designed into its software methods. System-specific controls often \ninteract with organization-wide controls and security measures. For example, \nan application that enables employees to view and modify their own personal \npayroll information generally relies on organization-wide identity management \nmethods, such as usernames and passwords. The importance of controls and security to modern systems might lead \nyou to believe that their design should be a security-specific design activity and \nshould be listed in Figure 6-3. Doing so would be consistent with security\u2019s \nimportance, but it would also obscure the fact that security and controls aren\u2019t \nseparate and distinct from other design activities. Rather, they are issues that \nneed to be embedded within all of the other design activities. That is, controls \nand security are important parts of other design activities, such as designing a \nuser interface, a database, or application components.

The first objective\u2014to maintain a stable operating environment\u2014focuses \non security measures to protect the organization\u2019s systems from external attacks \nfrom hackers, viruses, and worms, as well as denial-of-service attacks. The most \ncommon security control against such risks is a firewall installed between inter-\nnal systems and the Internet (see Figure 6-9). The second objective\u2014to protect transactions during transmission\u2014focuses \non the information that is sent or received via the Internet. Once a transaction \nis sent outside the organization, it could be intercepted, destroyed, or modified. Thus, designers define security controls that protect data in transit from the \nsource to the destination.

Encryption is the process of altering data so \nunauthorized users can\u2019t view them. Decryption is the process of converting \nencrypted data back to their original state. Data stored in files, or databases on \nhard drives or other storage devices, can be encrypted to protect against theft. Data sent across a network can be encrypted to prevent eavesdropping or theft \nduring transmission: A thief or eavesdropper who steals or intercepts encrypted \ndata receives a meaningless group of bits that are difficult or impossible to con-\nvert back into the original data. An encryption algorithm is a complex mathematical transformation that \nencrypts or decrypts binary data. An encryption key is a binary input to the \nencryption algorithm\u2014typically a long string of bits. The encryption algorithm \nvaries the data transformation based on the encryption key, so data can be \ndecrypted only with the same key or a compatible decryption key. Many encryp-\ntion algorithms are available, and a few\u2014including Data Encryption Standard \n(DES) and several algorithms developed by RSA Security\u2014are widely deployed \ngovernmental or Internet standards. An encryption algorithm must generate \nencrypted data that are difficult or impossible to decrypt without the encryp-\ntion key. Decryption without the key becomes more difficult as key length is \nincreased, and sender and receiver must use the same or compatible algorithms. Figure 6-13 shows an example of symmetric key encryption, in which \nthe same key encrypts and decrypts the data. A significant problem with sym-\nmetric key encryption is that sender and receiver use the same key, which must \nbe created and shared securely. Security is compromised if the key is transmit-\nted over the same channel as messages encrypted with the key. Further, sharing \na key among many users increases the possibility of key theft.

{"text": "177: CHAPTER 6 \u25a0 Foundations for Systems Design\nAn additional security measure for portable devices is a technique com-\nmonly called remote wipe, which automatically deletes sensitive data from \nportable devices under certain conditions, such as repeated failure to enter a \nvalid username and password, or an attempt to access a database or file from an \nunauthorized application. Remote wipe is commonly used with apps on porta-\nble devices that sync sensitive data from a server. An unauthorized synchroniza-\ntion attempt triggers the remote wipe via a command from the app or the server. Asymmetric key encryption uses different, but compatible keys to encrypt \nand decrypt data. Public key encryption is a form of asymmetric key encryp-\ntion that uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The \ntwo keys are like a matched pair. Once information is encrypted with the public \nkey, it can be decrypted only with the private key. It can\u2019t be decrypted with the \nsame public key that encrypted it. Organizations that use this technique broad-\ncast their public key so it is freely available to anybody who wants it. For exam-\nple, a company transmitting shipment data to a shipper can access the public key \nfrom the shipper\u2019s Web site and encrypt the shipment information before trans-\nmission. The shipper then decrypts the message with the private key. Because no \none else has the private key, no one else can decrypt the message. Some asymmetric encryption methods can encrypt and decrypt messages in \nboth directions.

A \ndigital signature is a technique in which a message or document is encrypted \nwith a private key and decrypted with the public key. For example, your bank \nmight encrypt a message sent to you with its private key. If you decrypt the mes-\nsage with your bank\u2019s public key and the message is readable, then you know \nthe message was sent by your bank. If you decrypt the message with the public \nkey and the result is gibberish, then you know the message was not sent by your \nbank. Encoding a message with a private key is called digital signing. Taking the example one step further, you can ask the question, \u201cHow do I \nknow that the public key I have is the correct public key and not some counter-\nfeit key?\u201d In other words, maybe someone is impersonating another entity and \npassing out false public keys to intercept encoded messages (such as financial \ntransactions) and steal information. In essence, the problem is ensuring that the \nkey purported to be the public key of some institution is, in fact, that institu-\ntion\u2019s public key. The solution to that problem is a certificate. A certificate\u2014or digital certificate\u2014is an institution\u2019s name and public key \n(plus other information, such as address, Web site URL, and validity date of the cer-\ntificate), encrypted and certified by a third party. Many third parties, such as Veri-\nSign and Equifax, are very well known and widely accepted \u00ad\ncertifying authorities. In fact, they are so well known that their public keys are built right into the current \nbrowsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer. As shown in Figure \n6-15, you can know that the entities with whom you are communicating are, in fact, \nwho they say they are, and that you do have their correct public key. An organization or individual who wants a certificate with his or her name \nand public key buys a certificate from a well-known certifying authority such \nas VeriSign. The certifying authority encrypts the data with its own private key \n(signs the data) and gives the data back to the original entity.

However, to ensure that the public key contained within the certificate is valid, \nthe certificates are transmitted to the certifying authority for verification. The \nauthority stores certificate data, including public keys, within its database and \nverifies transmitted certificates by matching their content against the database. \u275a\n\u275aSecure Transactions\nSecure electronic transactions require a standard set of methods and protocols \nthat address authentication, authorization, privacy, and integrity. Netscape orig-\ninally developed the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to support secure transac-\ntions. SSL was later adopted as an Internet standard and renamed Transport \nLayer Security (TLS), although the original name is still widely used. TLS is a method for secure message transmission over the Internet. Sender \nand receiver first establish a connection by using ordinary Internet protocols and \nask each other to create a TLS connection. Sender and receiver then verify each \nother\u2019s identity by exchanging and verifying identity certificates as explained \npreviously. At this point, either or both have exchanged public keys, so they \ncan send secure messages. Because asymmetric encryption is quite slow and dif-\nficult, the two entities agree on a protocol and encryption method\u2014usually a \nsingle-key encryption method. Of course, all the messages to establish a secure \nconnection are sent by using the public key/private key combination. Once the \nencryption technique has been determined and the secret, single key has been \ntransmitted, all subsequent transmission is done by using the secret, single key. IP Security (IPSec) is a newer Internet standard for secure message trans-\nmission. IPSec is usually implemented by operating systems or within network \nhardware devices, which enables it to operate with greater speed. IPSec can \nreplace or complement SSL. The two protocols can be used at the same time \nto provide an extra measure of security. IPSec supports more secure encryption \nmethods than SSL. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an Internet standard \nfor securely transmitting Web pages. HTTPS supports several types of encryp-\ntion, digital signing, and certificate exchange and verification. All modern Web \nbrowsers and servers support HTTPS. It is a complete approach to Web-based \nsecurity, although security is enhanced when HTTPS documents are sent over \nsecure TLS or IPSec channels.", "domains": ["Software Quality Attributes", "Domain-Driven Design"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

The design encompasses \nkey parts of the system, including its environment, ap-\nplication components, user interfaces, database, and \nsoftware classes and methods. A description or design \nactivity is associated with each design element. Design \nactivity inputs consist of the models that were built \nduring analysis. The outputs of the design consist of \na set of diagrams, or models, that describe the archi-\ntecture of the new system and the detailed logic within \nvarious programming components. Key design elements include application com-\nponents, the user interface, the database, and soft-\nware classes and methods. Each element is the focus \nof a separate design activity, though the timing and \nordering of activities varies from project to project. A\u00a0separate activity also defines the environment within \nwhich the system will be built and operated. Environ-\nmental characteristics tend to limit design choices and \nflexibility. Integrity controls operate within a specific sys-\ntem to reject invalid data inputs, prevent unauthorized \ndata outputs, and protect data and programs against \naccidental or malicious tampering. Security controls \ncross multiple systems to protect assets of an organiza-\ntion from all threats, with a primary focus on external \nthreats. Although integrity and security controls are \nimportant design elements, there is no separate activ-\nity to create them; control development is included in \neach of the other design activities to ensure a robust \nand reliable system.

For a year \nnow, Schultz had been the vice president and chief infor-\nmation officer for a medium-sized supplier of electronic \ncomponents to several large electronics firms, including \nSamsung and Acer. James\u2019s company, \u00ad\nWysotronics Inc., \nhad been in business for many years, but had recently \nbeen having some problems with its internal computer \nsystems. James was hired to fix the problems. Soon after starting this job, James discovered that \nmost systems were functioning properly, but that the \ninfrastructure was a hodgepodge of disjointed comput-\ners and networks. On the corporate side, there were \naccounting systems and human resource systems, both \nof which were desktop client/server systems hosted on \na local network computer that resided in the Accounting \nDepartment. Engineering had its own database and network com-\nputers, which hosted several sophisticated engineering \nsystems with intensive computing requirements. The \nengineers\u2019 local desktop systems were the most recent, \nup-to-date equipment and software. The server was \nalso high capacity, with a large data repository to house \nall the engineering documents and images. Marketing and Sales also had their own systems \nhosted on their own network server, which was con-\nnected to the Internet. The sales staff worked closely \nwith the manufacturing and assembly plants to ensure \nthat deliveries were on time, and they were frequently \non the road, visiting Wysotronics\u2019s clients. It was their \njob to ensure that clients were satisfied with schedules, \ndeliveries, and product quality, and they wanted to be \nable to access the sales and production databases while \nthey were on the road. Unfortunately, the servers they \nused weren\u2019t very stable and continually had problems. Perhaps the biggest problem was the supply chain \nmanagement system. Wysotronics had a large manu-\nfacturing plant, an assembly plant, and several suppliers \nthat needed access to the inventory and supply chain \nsystem. The current infrastructure didn\u2019t have enough \ncapabilities to provide timely information to these facili-\nties and suppliers. Today\u2019s meeting objective was to plan and config-\nure the total infrastructure of corporate systems.

Technology and architecture are usually covered as part of an entire stand-\nalone course or in parts of several courses in most information system degree \nprograms. Systems analysis is usually a separate course (or two). Because this \nbook is targeted to students completing a systems analysis and design course, a \ncomplete coverage of technology and architecture isn\u2019t appropriate.

However, those benefits come at a \ncost. Web applications are a well-defined target for security breaches because \nURLs and Web standards are open and widely known. Also, application perfor-\nmance can suffer when networks are congested. The impact of these challenges on the Amazon shopping application is \nsignificant. Amazon servers employ elaborate mechanisms to protect against \nthreats such as denial-of-service attacks, bogus transactions, and interception \nof customer credit card and other sensitive information in transit. To ensure \nadequate performance for a global customer base, Amazon uses redundant and \nglobally distributed servers connected to Internet backbone networks. \u275a\n\u275aEmbedded Software\nA modern laptop computer, tablet computer, or cell phone comes preinstalled \nwith a very complex OS, a Web browser, and a rich set of preinstalled apps. The \nOS has embedded software that provides functions for graphical display, touch \nscreen and gesture-based input, voice recognition, speech generation, music \nand video playback, and access to the Internet and Web resources. Embedding \nthese capabilities within the OS enables preinstalled or purchased apps and \nWeb-based applications to reuse the software that implements these functions. That reuse provides important benefits, including a similar look and feel across \napplications and application development toolkits for software developers that \nautomate many programming tasks and provide a direct interface to software \nalready embedded in the device. Embedded software components extend the functions of Web browsers and \nWeb servers in ways that enhance Web-based applications and the user experi-\nence. Examples include the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nToolbars. A set of links to Web resources or installed apps that extend the \ncapabilities of a Web browser. For example, an Acrobat PDF toolbar pro-\nvides Acrobat help links and one-click access to PDF document creation \nand management software. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nPlug-ins.

Developing application software that works on many device types\u2014for \nexample, desktops, laptops, and tablets (in addition to cell phones)\u2014adds even \nmore complexity. Fundamental differences in hardware and screen size forces \ndevelopers to adapt application software in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. For \ninstance, the keyboard and mouse/touch pad of a desktop or laptop computer \nmay dictate one style of data input, while the small virtual keyboard and touch \nscreen of a tablet or cell phone will dictate another approach. Screen size dictates \nsignificant differences between application software designed for a cell phone \ncompared with software designed for a desktop computer and its large\u00a0display. The Amazon shopping application has an interesting approach to dealing \nwith this complexity. Amazon doesn\u2019t provide installable apps for iOS, Android, \nand Google devices. Users with devices running those operating systems use \na Web application, and Amazon invests considerable resources in developing \nserver-side application software that adapts its user experience to the software \nenvironment of the user\u2019s device.

This is an important issue because \nmany computers and networks employ software programs or hardware devices \ncalled firewalls. Firewalls examine incoming and outgoing packets and block \nthose arriving from or sent to \u201cdangerous\u201d URLs or network address. Thus, an \ninformation system designer must ensure that network messages among soft-\nware components won\u2019t be blocked by a firewall at either end. For increased security, the system designer may want to work with security \nand network specialists to develop a virtual private network (VPN) to isolate \nsensitive communications between servers or between an organization\u2019s own \nemployees and servers. A VPN incorporates technologies covered in \u00ad\nChapter\u00a06, \nincluding Secure Sockets Layers, Transport Layer Security, and secure IP, to \nreliably identify senders and recipients, and encrypt network messages sent \namong them. The Amazon.com shopping application doesn\u2019t use secure network proto-\ncols for server-to-customer communication until the user needs to transmit sen-\nsitive data, such as when providing credit card information. All traffic among \nAmazon servers and those of its key partners, such as payment processors and \nshippers, is secured using virtual private networks. \u275a\n\u275aWeb Protocols\nThe World Wide Web is built on a small family of protocols for encoding \nWeb documents and hyperlinks, requesting documents from Web servers, \nand responding to those requests. The most important protocols include the \nfollowing:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nURL. As defined earlier, a URL defines a document or resource name, \nlocation, and encoding protocol. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nHypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTML defines the structure and \ncontent of a Web page, including encoding methods for text, images, tables, \nand forms with the ability to control such aspects as text font and size, and \nthe location of text and images on a displayed or printed page. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nExtensible Markup Language (XML).

For example, in Figure 7-3 the text $13.22 might \ninclude additional encoding information that identifies it as a product \nprice stated in U.S. dollars. A price comparison service could use such \ninformation to compare prices for the same product across multiple \n\u00ad\nshopping sites. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nHypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP defines the format and \n\u00ad\ncontent of requests for Web documents and resources, and includes some \nsimple commands for other types of requests, such as uploading a file or \npage. For example, Web browsers normally request that a Web page be \ntransmitted for display via the HTTP GET command. Data entered by a \nuser in an HTML form is normally transmitted back to a Web server using \nthe HTTP POST command. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). HTTPS is an extension of \nHTTP that employs secure network protocols to reliably identify senders \nand recipients and encrypt network messages sent among them. As with network protocols, Web protocols are nearly universal and thus of \nlittle direct concern to information system designers. The primary issue is which \nversions of Web protocols are supported by software on servers and end-user \ncomputing devices. For example, HTML5 is a recent update to earlier HTML \nprotocol versions. It provides some new capabilities that Web application and \nWeb service developers may want to incorporate into their systems. However, \nmany users have older computing devices and software that don\u2019t support \nHTML5.

It occurs with \nother types of protocols and with support for specific operating systems. A user\u2019s initial connection to the Amazon.com shopping application uses \na URL that initiates the transfer of a Web page from an Amazon server to the \nuser\u2019s Web browser. At that time, the Amazon Web server queries the user\u2019s \nWeb browser to determine its type, what protocols it supports, and the underly-\ning OS.", "domains": ["Design Patterns"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

Application software is deployed \non a technology architecture by distributing application components to specific \nhardware devices and connecting them via networks and protocols. Technology and application architecture are interdependent. Poor technology \narchitecture provides a weak foundation for application software and can com-\nprise its performance, reliability, and other characteristics. Good technology archi-\ntecture enhances those characteristics and provides other benefits, such as minimal \noperating cost and flexible updating. But high-quality technology architecture can\u2019t \nmake up for poor application architecture. Application software must be designed \nto ensure ease of construction, deployment, operation, and future updates. Popular literature and culture usually refer to technology in abstract terms, \nand there is an underlying assumption that any useful technology will be \nadopted and exploited. But an organization must trade off the potential benefits \nof adopting and deploying useful technologies with the cost of supporting those \ntechnologies and the possibility of overextending its ability to manage and suc-\ncessfully exploit them. For example, should an organization immediately move \nits applications to \u201clatest and greatest\u201d technologies, or should it wait until it \nbecomes clearer which of those technologies are useful and widely adopted? Once it decides to adopt a technology, which \u201cflavor(s)\u201d should it choose? What \nspecific hardware, software, and protocols should it deploy and support? These are important questions because no organization has sufficient \nresources to constantly reimplement existing information systems using all pos-\nsible new and updated technologies. An organization must choose technologies \nthat match its application needs and support those technologies over a period of \nyears or decades. The technology architecture must evolve slowly over time to \nenable new functions, new ways of working, and new ways of interacting with \ncustomers and strategic partners. \u25a0\n\u25a0Software as a Service\nA service is something that we purchase rather than making or doing it our-\nselves. For example, we consider our household utilities such as water, electricity, \nand trash pickup to be services. We don\u2019t have to have our own power generator \nto get electricity. We just buy power as we use it. Another example is service on \nour vehicles. When something breaks on our cars, we pay an auto mechanic to \nfix it.

For items that are out of stock, the Web application can \ninteract with publisher Web services to locate available sale items and estimate \nthe time to ship them to an Amazon warehouse or direct ship then from the \n\u00ad\npublisher warehouse to a customer. The implications of Web services for system design are significant. Summa-\nrized at the strategic level, information system developers must do the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nScan the range of available Web services and decide which to incorporate \ninto their software. To the extent they include other Web services, they \nexpand the functions of their own software with minimal related develop-\nment cost. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nDecide which (if any) functions of their own software should be implemented \nas Web services and made available to other systems. To the extent they do \nso, they increase the potential base of software users, but also commit to \nmaking those services available in a reliable and secure fashion over a long \ntime period. At a more detailed level, the decision to use or provide Web services leads \nto many other questions about system design, development, and deployment, \nincluding the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWhat protocols will be used to accept Web service calls and to pass data in \nboth directions? \u25a0\n\u25a0\nHow will data passed to/from Web services be secured? \u25a0\n\u25a0\nEven if no Web services are made available to external users, should some \nportions of the system be structured as Web services to facilitate access and \nuse by other internal systems? \u25a0\n\u25a0\nWhat performance and availability guarantees will be provided to Web \n\u00ad\nservice users? \u25a0\n\u25a0\nWhat server, network, and other resources are needed to satisfy those \nguarantees? We\u2019ll revisit some of these questions in the examples later in this chapter. \u25a0\n\u25a0Distributed Architectures\nDistribution of system components across machines, server farms, and oceans is \nan inescapable facet of modern system architecture.

A client uses the communication interface to request resources, and the server \nresponds to these requests. The client/server architectural model can be applied in many ways.

Figure 7-12 illustrates an internally deployed system with a three-\nlayer architecture, and it shows how the three layers might be configured across \nthree separate computing platforms: desktop and laptop clients, a Web/applica-\ntion server, and a database server. The view layer resides on all the client computers. The HTML is interpreted \nand displayed by the Web browser on the client computers. The view layer soft-\nware components that format the HTML are on the application server. The \ndata layer consists of the database server and any application programs on the \napplication server that are necessary to access the data. The business logic layer \nresides on the application server computer and includes all the logic to process \nthe business rules. A major benefit of three-layer architecture is its inherent flexibility. Interac-\ntions among the layers are always requests or responses that follow a Web or \nother protocol, which make the layers relatively independent of one another. It\u00a0doesn\u2019t matter where other layers are implemented or on what type of com-\nputer or operating system they execute. The only interlayer dependencies are a \ncommon protocol for requests and responses and a reliable network with suf-\nficient communication capacity. Multiple layers can execute on the same computer, or each layer can \noperate on a separate computer. Complex layers can be split across two or \nmore computers. System capacity can be increased by splitting layer functions \nacross computers or by load sharing across redundant computers. In the event \nof a malfunction, redundancy improves system reliability because the server \nload can be shifted from one computer to another. In sum, three-layer archi-\ntecture provides the flexibility needed by modern organizations to deploy and \nredeploy information-processing resources in response to rapidly changing \nconditions.

We\u2019ve described \nhardware, software, protocols, and multiple architectural concepts. You\u2019ve \nencountered many new terms and acronyms and have developed some new per-\nspectives on things that you thought you already understood. You\u2019re probably \nsearching for a framework into which you place all of the new and updated infor-\nmation. You\u2019re also wondering: What does it all have to do with systems design? Interoperability is a perspective through which you can examine all of the \ndetails covered thus far. Interoperability is the ability (or lack thereof) of a \ncomponent or system to interact with other components or systems. The myriad \nhardware and software components that make up a modern information system \nmust work together. To ensure interoperability, system designers must do several \nthings, including the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUnderstand and describe the current environment in which the system will \noperate. That environment includes existing hardware and software com-\nponents, networks, and the protocols and APIs already in use. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nLook for existing software components and services that can provide \nneeded functions for the new system. Those functions must be interoper-\nable with the existing environment and with components that will be built. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nBuild components that can\u2019t be purchased as software modules or used as a \nservice. As with acquired components, these must be interoperable with all \nother system components and with existing environments. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nStructure and assemble the components in a way that is feasible to build, \ntest, deploy, and operate over the long term. That sounds like a tough and complex job because it is. Successful system \ndesigners are knowledgeable and experienced. They acquire a broad and deep \nknowledge of all of the topics discussed thus far in this chapter. They learn to \napply that knowledge by working as developers and by gradually completing \ndesign tasks for larger and more complex subsystems and systems. They constantly \nupdate their knowledge to keep up with rapidly changing technology. And they \nwork in teams because no one person can hold and successfully apply all of the \nknowledge needed to design and deploy a large-scale modern information system. \u25a0\n\u25a0Architectural Diagrams\nArchitectural diagrams are commonly used to visually describe an information \nsystem\u2019s environment, components, and deployment.", "domains": ["Software Quality Attributes", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

Expanding the range of user devices to include tablets and \nsmartphones will require updates to the supporting system software, APIs, and \ndevelopment tools. The current system relies on servers running the \u00ad\nWindows \noperating system with Internet Information Server as the Web server. That \ninfrastructure is sufficient to support apps in all of the current flavors (iOS, \nAndroid, and Windows) though additional plug-ins will have to be installed and \nconfigured in each device to support each app type. \u275a\n\u275aWeb Technologies and Adapted Content\nBecause some users won\u2019t install an app, the CSMS must also support a browser-\nbased user interface with support for multiple screen sizes, Web browsers, and \nplug-ins. That will require more complex user-interface coding than exists in the \ncurrent system, which simply serves static Web pages and forms. The updated \nuser-interface coding will need to query the user\u2019s device and browser and adjust \nthe content of the Web pages transmitted to match the device characteristics. As \nwith the apps, this may require supporting more modern Web protocols such as \nHTML5 and updated APIs and development tools. Structuring newly deployed applications as Web services will require \u00ad\nchanging \nthe way that RMO configures and manages servers. Note that each server in \nFigure 7-16 is dedicated to a specific system.

In addition, groups \nof servers are generally deployed for each service type to provide service \n\u00ad\ncontinuity in case one machine fails. \u275a\n\u275aSocial Networking\nSome of the impacts of incorporating social networking into the system mirror \nthose described earlier for apps and Web pages that adapt to the user\u2019s device.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

The diagram doesn\u2019t capture additional complexity \nassociated with updated security configuration and more complex software \nhosted within RMO\u2019s application servers. Increased network bandwidth is \nneeded throughout the architecture due to use of Web services, the increased \ncomplexity of user interfaces, and increased use of graphics and video.

External hosting of all or part of the CSMS is an option that can reduce risk, \nimprove performance, and possibly reduce cost. Hosting the application with a \nnational or global company, such as Google or Amazon, would enable RMO \nto take advantage of an existing and highly distributed computing infrastruc-\nture. Key components could be replicated at multiple locations to improve per-\nformance and to provide fault tolerance. Costs might be lower due to improved \neconomies of scale. Even if costs were the same or slightly higher, they might be \njustified by improved performance and fault tolerance.

{"text": "208: PART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Designing Application Components\nChapter 6 defined an application component as a well-defined unit of soft-\nware that performs one or more specific tasks. That definition masked some \nimportant details, including variations in component size ranging from single \nsubroutines or methods to entire subsystems; variations in programming lan-\nguage, protocols, and supporting system software; and the ability to build, buy, \nor freely access components as Web services of entire SaaS systems. This sec-\ntion concentrates on defining the functions and boundaries of larger application \ncomponents, including Web services and subsystems. Design of smaller applica-\ntion components, such as classes and packages, is covered in later chapters. \u25a0\n\u25a0Application Component Boundaries\nSystems analysis activities collect and document various aspects of systems \nrequirements that are needed to design application components. A key question \nto be answered when designing application components is which components \nwill perform which functions? Answering this question can be approached from \na top-down or bottom-up perspective. With a top-down approach, the designer \nthinks of the entire system as a single component performing all of the functions \ndescribed during analysis activities. The designer then breaks this large com-\nponent into smaller components in a generic process called factoring. With the \nbottom-up approach, the designer considers each function separately and looks \nfor similarities as a basis for grouping software that implements the functions \ninto larger application components. With either approach, the designer looks for similarities among system \nfunctions to guide factoring or grouping. But how does a designer determine or \nmeasure similarity among system functions? When answering that question, it \nhelps to focus on specific analysis activity descriptions like events and use cases. Events and use cases incorporate attributes that can be used to measure similar-\nity, including the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nActors. Each use case identifies one or more specific actors. Software for \nuse cases that interact with the same actors is a candidate for grouping into \na single application component. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nShared data.

However, because \nall of the use cases (Groups A\u2013D) have significant overlaps in users, domain classes, \nand events, it makes sense to combine them into a single business layer.

The drawback is that financial records \ndon\u2019t reflect purchasing transactions as they occur. A manager viewing purchas-\ning-related accounts through the FPR system is looking at yesterday\u2019s data. HRM data export to the FPR system is handled similarly, though the export \noccurs every two weeks to coincide with payroll generation and the file format \nis XML. The drawbacks and benefits are similar, though the issue of managers \naccessing \u201cold\u201d data through the FPR system is more significant. Employee time \nand attendance data is captured daily through the HRM system, but that data \nisn\u2019t shown on RMO financial reports until payroll is generated. Extra accounting \nsteps are thus required at the end of each month to manually adjust accounting \nrecords for accrued payroll cost so that financial reports are accurate. Sharing inventory information among three internally developed systems cre-\nates more significant integration challenges. The CSMS will replace the legacy phone \nand retail store sales systems that generate updates to inventory levels and financial \ntransactions. In theory, the CSMS, SCM, and Tradeshow systems could share the \nsame underlying database, thus eliminating the need to export or import inventory \ndata among them. However, the SCM is a legacy system that RMO would prefer to \nleave untouched during development of the Tradeshow System and CSMS. Note the two-way arrow between the SCM system and the CSMS in \n\u00ad\nFigure\u00a07-20. Both systems read and update inventory records and need current \nand accurate data. So which system \u201cowns\u201d inventory records? The answer is \nthat they both do, and that answer implies that the systems should share real-\ntime access to common data. But implementing that solution would require \nthe new CSMS to use the legacy SCM system\u2019s database. Though that solution \nis technically feasible, it forces new application software to interface with an \nolder DBMS, which may limit some desired capabilities of the CSMS. Also, \nwhat about noninventory data used by the CSMS? Will the SCM database be \nexpanded to include that data or will the CSMS access two different databases?

Those bridge activities include describing the \nsystem environment and designing its application \ncomponents. Describing the system\u2019s environment re-\nquires describing its technical architecture and any \ninterfaces with other systems. Designing the applica-\ntion components requires allocating system functions \nto components, describing how data is shared among \nthose components, and describing how the application \ncomponents are distributed across the technical \narchitecture. Diagrams developed during these design activities \ninclude locations, network, and deployment diagrams. Location diagrams are customized maps that show the \nphysical locations of users and computing devices. Net-\nwork diagrams show computing devices and the networks \nthat connect them.

In actuality, designing the user \ninterface has characteristics of both analysis activities and design activities. As an analysis activity, user-interface design requires very heavy user \ninvolvement. You saw a good example of this in the chapter opening case. Screen \nlayout is a discovery activity and produces deep understanding of the user pro-\ncesses and needs just like other analysis activities. During the analysis activities, \ndevelopers discuss inputs and outputs early and often with system stakeholders \nto identify users and actors and the information they need to carry out their \nbusiness processes. In the following sections, you will learn different ways to \nthink about and to model the user interface to help yourself and the user con-\nsider various methods of interacting with the new system. As a design activity, user-interface design utilizes other analysis models as \ninput, such as the system sequence diagram. It also produces models in the form \nof sample layouts that are used by programmers to implement the final system. Because few systems operate autonomously or in isolation, designing the inter-\nfaces (inputs and outputs) between a system and its users is an important sys-\ntems design task. Poorly designed interfaces with people can result in a system \nthat operates less than optimally or doesn\u2019t fulfill its purpose. In this chapter, \nOpening case\u2002 Interface Design at Aviation Electronics\nBob Crain was admiring the user interface for the manu-\nfacturing support system that was recently installed at \nAviation Electronics (AE). Bob is the plant manager for \nAE\u2019s Midwest manufacturing facility, which produces \naviation devices used in commercial aircraft. These avia-\ntion devices provide guidance and control functions for \nflight crews, and they provide the latest safety and secu-\nrity features that pilots need when flying commercial \naircraft. The manufacturing support system is used for all \nfacets of the manufacturing process, including product \nplanning, purchasing, parts inventory, quality control, \n\u00ad\nfinished goods inventory, and distribution. Bob was \nextensively involved in the development of the system \nfor several years, including the initial planning and devel-\nopment. The information systems team that developed \nthe system relied heavily on Bob\u2019s expertise. That was \nthe easy part for Bob.

{"text": "218: That was \nthe easy part for Bob. What particularly pleased Bob was the final user \ninterface. He had insisted that the development team \nconsider the entire user experience from the very begin-\nning. He didn\u2019t want just another cookie-cutter transac-\ntion processing system. He wanted a system that acted \nas a partner in the manufacturing process\u2014similar to \nthe way that AE\u2019s guidance and control system inter-\nfaces acted as a pilot\u2019s partner. The first manager assigned to the project placed a \nlow priority on user-interface design. When Bob asked \nwhy user-interface design wasn\u2019t a key focus of early \niterations, the manager replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll add the user \ninterface later, after we work out the internal func-\ntions.\u201d When Bob insisted that the project manager be \nreplaced, the Information Systems Department sent \nSara Robinson to lead the project. Sara had a completely different attitude; she started \nout by asking about events that affect the manufacturing \nprocess and about cases where users needed support \nfrom the system. Bob and Sara conducted meetings to \ninvolve users in discussions about how they might use \nthe system, even asking users to act out the roles of the \nuser and the system in carrying on interactions. At other meetings, Sara presented sketches of \nscreens and asked users to draw on them to indicate the \ninformation they wanted to see and options they wanted \nto be able to select. These sessions produced many \nideas. For example, it appeared that many users didn\u2019t \nsit at their desks all day; they needed larger and more \ngraphic displays they could see from across the room. Many users needed to refer to several displays, and they \nneeded to be able to read them simultaneously. Users \nmade sketches showing how the manufacturing pro-\ncess actually worked, and the team used these sketches \nto define much of the interface. Sara and her team kept \ncoming back every month or so with more examples to \nshow, asking for more suggestions. When the system was finally completed and \ninstalled, most users already knew how to use it \nbecause they had been so involved in its design. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

User-interface design is much more complex than it used to be, even just \na few years ago. Users are doing much more with multiple computing devices. User-interface design was initially only concerned with the layout of screens and \nreports. Today, you must consider the entire user experience\u2014what devices are \nbeing used and what the users are doing on those devices. Designing the user \ninterface is dependent not only on the type of device, such as desktop, laptop, \ntablet, or smartphone, but also on the specific types of devices that are being \nused, such as Apple or Android or Windows devices and operating systems. In \nthis chapter, you will learn general guidelines and principles that can be applied \nacross all user-interface and user-experience design. \u25a0\n\u25a0Understanding the User Experience and  \nthe User Interface\nThe use of computing devices and applications continues to proliferate into all \naspects of our lives. Does the use of these applications make us more knowledge-\nable or more empowered? Or do they make our lives more complex with added \nfrustrations? The answer to these questions depends not only on the functional-\nity provided, but also on how easy it is to understand and use these applications. As a developer, you must have a deep understanding of users, applications, \ndevices, techniques, and principles to build effective user interfaces. \u25a0\n\u25a0Definitions\nThe user experience (UX) is a broad concept that applies to all aspects of a \nperson\u2019s interaction with a product or service. When the product is a software \napplication, UX includes actions, responses, perceptions, and feelings that a per-\nson has when he uses or anticipates using the software application. It is impor-\ntant for designers to think about the overall user experience as they consider the \ndesign of the new system and particularly the user interface. The user interface (UI) is the set of inputs and outputs that directly involve \nan application user. It is the part of the system that the user sees and interacts with.

Because the user interface is the only part of the system that the users see, to them \nthe user interface is the system. UI design varies widely depending on such factors \nas interface purpose, user characteristics, and characteristics of a specific interface \ndevice. For example, although all user interfaces should be designed for maximal \nease of use, other considerations, such as operational efficiency, may be impor-\ntant for internal users who can be trained to use a specific interface optimized \nfor a specific hardware device (e.g., a keyboard, a mouse, and a large high-resolu-\ntion display). In contrast, a quite different user interface might be designed for a \n\u00ad\ncustomer-accessible system that assumes a cell phone as the input/output device. Sometimes developers think the user interface can be developed and added \nto the system near the end of the development process, but as noted in the open-\ning case, the user interface is much more important than that. The user interface \nis a major element in the total user experience. Both the considerations related \nto the user experience and the details of the user interface must be integrated \ninto all elements of the system development. Developers must be aware that \neverything that the end user sees or does while using the system is part of the \nuser interface and affects the user experience.

Design techniques that embody this point of view are collectively \ncalled user-centered design, which emphasizes three important principles:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFocus early and throughout the project on the users and their work. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nEvaluate all designs to ensure usability. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nUse iterative development. An early focus on users and their work is consistent with the approach to \nsystems analysis in this text. User-oriented analysis and design tasks are per-\nformed as early as possible and are often given higher priority than other tasks. For example, such user-oriented analysis tasks as stakeholder identification and \ninterviews occur early in the project. User interfaces are designed in early itera-\ntions, and user-related design decisions drive other design decisions and tasks. The second principle of user-centered design is to evaluate designs to ensure \nusability. Usability refers to how easy a system is to learn and use. Ensuring \nusability isn\u2019t easy; there are many different types of users with different prefer-\nences and skills. If the system has a variety of end users, how can the designer \nbe sure that the interface will work well for all of them? For example, if it is too \nflexible, some end users might feel lost. On the other hand, if the interface is too \nrigid, some users will be frustrated. Furthermore, ease of learning and ease of use are often in conflict. For \nexample, menu-based applications with multiple forms, many dialog boxes, \nand extensive prompts and instructions are easy to learn; indeed, they are self-\nexplanatory. Easy-to-learn interfaces are appropriate for systems that end users \nuse infrequently.

After each iteration, the project team evaluates the work \non the system to date. Iterative development keeps the focus on the user by con-\ntinually returning to the user requirements during each iteration and by evaluat-\ning the system after each iteration. Jakob Nielson, Donald Norman, and Bruce Tognazzini (see Further \nResources) are active researchers in human-computer interaction (HCI), a \nfield of study concerned with the efficiency and effectiveness of user interfaces \nto computer systems, human-oriented input and output technology, and the psy-\nchological aspects of user interfaces. HCI is a broad field with many closely \nrelated fields of study, including interaction design, efficiency, ergonomics, soci-\netal impacts, psychological influences, and so forth. Although the actual computing devices that people use are physical enti-\nties, the items that appear on the screens are virtual entities. They exist only as \nimages and sounds. Because of this, it is helpful for HCI developers to use meta-\nphors based on real-world physical entities and actions to design a user interface \nwith a positive user experience. \u25a0\n\u25a0Metaphors for Human-Computer Interaction\nTo make computers easier to use and learn, designers of early visually oriented \ninterfaces adopted metaphors, which are analogies between features of the user \ninterface and aspects of physical reality that users are familiar with.

{"text": "223: CHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Fundamental Principles of User-Interface Design\nMany information technology (IT) researchers and practitioners have published \narticles, books, and Web sites that offer guidance in user-interface design. Many \nof these guidelines are accepted best practices, having been around for decades. However, the proliferation of new applications, a variety of computing devices, \nand innovative ways to communicate has required new approaches and prin-\nciples for user-interface design. This section provides explanations of some of the most important universal \nguidelines. It is organized into six major categories: human-interface objects, \nconsistency, discoverability, closure, readability and navigation, and usability \nand efficiency. \u25a0\n\u25a0Human-Interface Objects\nHuman-interface objects (HIOs) are those objects that appear on a screen \nthat the user can manipulate. Included are such things as documents, buttons, \nmenus, folders, and icons. The following sections discuss several important \nprinciples that apply to the design and utility of human-interface objects. \u275a\n\u275aUse Human-Interface Objects That Reflect Their  \nPurpose or Behavior (Affordance)\nThe use of HIOs is very common in almost all of today\u2019s applications. The most \ncommon ones we are familiar with are buttons or other small icons. In new ver-\nsions of the Microsoft Office suite, the ribbons of icons at the top of the page are \na good example of useful HIOs whose appearance reflects their function. The \ntechnical term for this characteristic is called affordance. Affordance means \nthat the appearance of a specific control suggests its function\u2014that is, the pur-\npose for which the control is used. For example, a control that looks like a steer-\ning wheel suggests that it is used for turning. Affordance can also be achieved \nby a user-interface control that the user is familiar with in another context. For \nexample, the media player control icons shown in Figure 8-5 were first widely \nused on audiotape and videotape players and are still used in such devices as \nDVD and portable music players. They are widely incorporated into computer \ninterfaces because so many users are familiar with them. Notice in the figure \nthat a tool tip is provided. Tool tips are brief instructions that appear when the \nmouse hovers over a particular tool. \u275a\n\u275aHIOs Should Provide Visual Feedback When Activated\nA second and related characteristic is that HIOs should provide immediate feed-\nback when activated or receiving focus.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

Visibility means that a control is visible \nso users know it is available; it also means that the control provides immediate \nfeedback to indicate that it is responding. Feedback is some visual or audio \nresponse by the system in response to some user action. Figure 8-5 is also an \nexample of visibility and feedback. The controls are always visible at the bot-\ntom of the window and show immediate feedback on mouseover or mouse click. human-interface objects (HIOs)\u2003 icons \nand other objects on a screen that can be \nmanipulated by the user and cause some \naction to occur\naffordance\u2003 when the appearance of a \n\u00ad\nspecific control suggests its function\ntool tip\u2003 brief instructions that pop up when \nthe mouse hovers over a control\nvisibility\u2003 when a control is visible so that \nusers know it is available\nfeedback\u2003 some visual or audio response by \nthe system in response to a user action\nFigure 8-5 Example of affordance \nin media player controls\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "224: PART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nAnother example of visibility and feedback is shown in Figure 8-6, with a group \nof radio buttons and a check box. A group of radio buttons is a control that \nallows one item to be selected out of the group. A group of check boxes is a con-\ntrol that allows none or many items to be selected. As a radio button is selected, \nnot only does it change its color, but the image also immediately changes. An \neffective HIO performs some visible action when the mouse hovers over it. It \nperforms some other visible action when it is clicked or double-clicked. Feedback provides the user with a sense of confirmation and the feeling that \na system is responsive and functioning correctly. Lack of feedback leaves the \n \nuser wondering whether a command or input was recognized or whether the\u00a0sys-\ntem is malfunctioning. Visibility and affordance are relatively easy to achieve when the design tar-\nget is a commonly used platform, such as an iPad, a cell phone running the \nAndroid operating system, or a PC running Windows. Such platforms have well-\ndefined user-interface design guidelines and a library of user-interface features \nand functions that can be reused by application software. Web user-interface design is less standardized. In some cases, a new icon is \nused and it is just expected that the user will become familiar with it. Often, these \nicons are only recognized because of trial and error. Two examples come to mind. The small gear icon has been used to represent settings or options. Another icon, \nthree small bars, is also used. The attempt is to look like a drop-down menu, \nbut it took users a long while to recognize it as a metaphor for settings. Another \ndifficult example is the matrix of small squares to represent applications. This is \nfound on the Google account page. Many users still don\u2019t recognize its purpose. \u25a0\n\u25a0Consistency\nConsistency can be applied to many different aspects of the user interface, as well as \nto the application itself. The effectiveness of the user experience is highly dependent \non consistency. Users not only expect consistency across the various screens of an \napplication, but now also anticipate consistency across applications. The following \nsections itemize different levels or areas where consistency should be maintained.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "225: CHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\n\u275a\n\u275aConsistency Within and Across Platforms\nConsistency within a platform is usually fairly achievable because the tools to \nbuild applications and the libraries of existing icons are common and available for \nall developers. For example, when building Windows applications, it is common \nto use the standard icons, buttons, check boxes, and other user-interface icons. However, it is more difficult for developers to achieve consistency across \nplatforms. For desktop computers, there three common operating environments: \nWindows, Apple, and UNIX. For smaller mobile devices, there are several dif-\nferent environments, including Android, Windows, Apple, and BlackBerry. Web browsers that execute across multiple platforms help bring consistency \nto \u00ad\nWeb-based applications, but they do not solve the problem completely. It is \nalways a challenge for developers who have cross-platform applications to make \nthe user interface as consistent as possible for cross-platform users. \u275a\n\u275aConsistency Within a Suite of Applications\nMany software organizations have developed and sell a suite of related applica-\ntions. In many instances, these applications were developed by separate develop-\nment teams with little communication between teams. The result, of course, is \nthat the user interface for each application has components, and maybe even the \nentire interface, that are distinct for each application. Organizations that provide \na suite should have a coordination group to ensure consistency within the suite. The Microsoft Office suite is a good example of consistency within the \nsuite. Originally, only the three main components of the suite (Word, Excel, and \n\u00ad\nPowerPoint) had similar user interfaces. However, as Microsoft has acquired other \napplications and moved them into the suite, it has modified the user interfaces to be \nconsistent. For example, Access, Visio, and Project are not part of the basic suite, \nbut the user interface on these applications now has a consistent look and feel with \nthe ribbon bar across the top and common icons within the ribbon. Figure 8-7 \nshows the menu ribbon for three Microsoft applications: Visio, Excel, and Word. \u275a\n\u275aConsistency Within an Application\nSurprisingly, this concept is probably one of the most violated among developers. Consistency in using the same standard HIOs is quite easily achieved. They are \nprovided in standard libraries. However, when designing such interface items as \ninput forms or data display screens, it is easy to design inconsistent screens.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "227: CHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\nOne option is to have a limited number of icons, but have all items listed in the \nmenu hierarchy. However, even that approach does not work in all cases. Some-\ntimes it is necessary to have functions or features that exist underneath the \n\u00ad\ninitial user interface and must be discovered. Discoverability is that feature of \nthe user interface that provides clues to help the users uncover hidden features. It is important that developers consider the discoverability aspect of user- \ninterface design. One example of features that are not visible or obvious are all the opera-\ntions that can be performed using the boundary and title bar of a window in \nWindows 8.1. The only ways to learn about these features is to either watch a \ntutorial video or to learn by trial and error. For example, moving the window \nwith the title bar to an edge causes it to snap to full size. Another example is \nclosing a metro-style app in Windows 8. To close these full-screen apps, the user \nmust grab the top of the app and pull it to the bottom of the screen. This feature \nwas not obvious, and in fact took many users quite a while to figure it out. \u275a\n\u275aUse Active Discovery to Help Find Hidden Features\nActive discovery is a user-interface feature that leads users into discovering \nhidden features. There are several methods a designer can use to implement \nactive discovery. One approach is to have a pop-up window appear at applica-\ntion initiation that provides hints and additional features. Another approach is \nto have a small text box appear as the user hovers over different locations of the \nscreen. This technique is best implemented with a slight delay so that the user is \nnot continually being distracted by the opening and closing of myriad text boxes. One technique of active discovery used by the Microsoft Office suite is the \ngrouping of similar icons within the ribbon. In the lower-right corner of each \ngroup is a small arrow, which indicates that there are more features and func-\ntions available. This small clue helps the users find the additional features that \nare not as visible. Figure 8-9 returns to the DVD player controls to show these techniques. Notice that some controls are visible, but other controls are hidden.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W. Satzinger, Robert B.

{"text": "228: PART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u275a\n\u275aUse Visual Diagrams to Help Users Discover Functions or Tools\nThis third guideline is related to the Help feature of an application. When the user \ncannot find a desired feature on the user interface, she will sometimes resort to the \nF1 key or the Help function. Unfortunately, some applications are becoming less \nuser-friendly in this arena. Because most devices are now connected to the Internet, \noften the F1 key will connect to a server and display the general-purpose Help Web \nsite. In most cases, a user only wants a quick answer to a simple question. A\u00a0small \npop-up window with some instruction or a \u00ad\ndiagram is still the best solution. A powerful way to answer a quick query is with a small diagram that dis-\nplays what action to take. Figure 8-10 shows a simple diagram that is very \nexpressive of how to perform a desired action. \u25a0\n\u25a0Closure\nThe idea of closure is based on the dialogue metaphor that was discussed ear-\nlier. In most cases, especially for organizational procedures, a use case requires \nseveral steps to complete. Sometimes this requires multiple screens; sometimes it \ncan be done with a single screen. In either event, the user interface should have a \nclearly defined beginning and ending. \u275a\n\u275aProvide Closure on Dialogues\nClosure is related to the concept of visibility and feedback discussed ear-\nlier. Feedback provided on the HIOs is one technique used to provide closure. \u00ad\nHowever, feedback on an individual HIO does not necessarily imply closure. For example, a Save button may change colors and make a clicking sound when \nit is clicked. However, to ensure closure, it is helpful to have a message pop up \nsaying that the work was saved or the action was completed. The same prin-\nciple applies to a Cancel button. The Cancel button should provide visual and \naudio feedback, but refreshing the data fields on a cancel action provides a more \ndeclarative closure. When a use case requires several steps, it is important that the user know \nthat all the steps are completed. One technique to implement this process is to \nhave a Continue button and a Finish button that indicate the end of the process. Sometimes a progress bar is also included and a final message to indicate that \nthe dialogue has successfully finished.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

Another common feature is to inform \nthe user when she tries to save a newer version of a file on top of an older one. These are effective techniques. However, how many of us have filled out an online form and had to start \nover again because of either an error or the need to change an input value on \nthe original form? For example, when purchasing concert tickets or airline res-\nervations, if you only want to change a date or time, often the application will \nrequire you to complete the entire form for every change. That approach does \nnot conform to the principle of saving the user\u2019s work. As much as possible, the \nuser interface should capture and remember the data entered by the user. \u275a\n\u275aMake Actions Reversible (Undo)\nUsers always make mistakes and often need to undo a recent step. Both the \napplication and the user interface must support this reverse function. Users need \nto feel that they can explore options and take actions that can be canceled or \nreversed without difficulty. This is one way that users learn about the system\u2014\nthat is, by experimenting. It is also a way to prevent errors; as users recognize \nthey have made a mistake, they cancel the action. In addition, designers should \nbe sure to include Cancel buttons on all dialog boxes and allow users to go back \na step at any time. Finally, when the user deletes something substantial\u2014a file, \na record, or a transaction\u2014the system should ask the user to confirm the action \nand, where possible, delay implementing the action. \u25a0\n\u25a0Readability and Navigation\nThe concept of readability and navigation are particularly important today, yet \ncan be difficult to support. Though large desktop screens usually are quite read-\nable, readability with small mobile devices is often a serious problem. Large \ndesktop screens also have a lot of space for clues about navigating through vari-\nous screens of an application. The small screens on mobile devices often require \nthat the navigation tools be hidden or partially hidden. \u275a\n\u275aText Should Be Readable (Type, Size, and Color)\nThere are two primary considerations when designing text to be displayed: the \nage of your target population and the devices that will be used.

Older popula-\ntions normally require large fonts with clear distinction from the background. Smaller mobile devices limit the amount of text that can reasonably be displayed, \nso both the type of font and the organization of the text are important. One help-\nful consideration is that the actual data to be displayed is more important than \nthe labels. Of course, the data must be labeled sufficiently to be understood, but \nthe actual transfer of information occurs with the changing data, not the labels. The font type is also important. Fancy fonts are frequently hard to discern. Simple sans-serif fonts tend to be better for online reading. Figure 8-11 illus-\ntrates some of the issues with trying to be too fancy with fonts. This Web site \nadvertisement is way too busy. The font colors on the blue background make \nsome parts almost impossible to read. The fancy script lettering is also very \n\u00ad\ndifficult to read. \u275a\n\u275aNavigation Should Be Clear\nNavigation through an application or a Web site depends heavily on the orga-\nnization of the user interface. The user interface can be organized in a deeply \nhierarchical vertical fashion or a shallow approach with a flat horizontal span \nof forms or pages. The vertical approach has fewer menu items at the top level, \nbut requires multiple levels of submenus. The horizontal approach has many \nmenu items at the top level and fewer levels of submenus. The organization of \n \nthe application or Web site is then reflected in the menu hierarchy provided. Copyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "231: CHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\n\u275a\n\u275aProvide Shortcut Keys to Support Experienced Users\nSoftware applications normally must be prepared to support users at many \ndifferent levels of competency and training. Novice users need clear naviga-\ntion through sequences of steps to complete a task. More advanced users want \nto complete a task in the fewest steps possible. Hence, user interfaces must be \ndesigned to support users across a wide range of capability and expertise. User interfaces designed primarily for novices are often an annoyance and \nan impediment to experienced users\u2019 productivity. Users who work with an \napplication repeatedly or for long time periods want shortcuts for frequently \nused functions, which minimize the number of keystrokes, mouse clicks, and \nmenu selections required to complete tasks. Examples include voice commands \nas well as shortcut keys, such as Windows keyboard sequences Ctrl+C for \ncopy and Ctrl+V for paste. It is always a good idea for application designers \nto include standard shortcuts when available or build their own for frequently \nrepeated functions. \u275a\n\u275aDesign Error Messages That Provide Solution Options\nA good user-interface design anticipates common errors and helps the user to \navoid them or correct them immediately when they occur. One way to do this is \nto limit available options, presenting the user with only valid options for a spe-\ncific point in a dialogue. Adequate feedback, as discussed previously, also helps \nreduce errors. When the system does find an error, the error message should state specifi-\ncally what is wrong and explain how to correct it. Consider this error message \nthat occurs after a user has typed in a full screen of information about a new \ncustomer:\nThe customer information entered is not valid. Try again. This message doesn\u2019t explain what is wrong or tell the user what to do next. Furthermore, what if the system clears the data-entry form after this message \nappears? The user would have to reenter everything previously typed but would still \nhave no idea what was wrong. A better error message would read more like this:\nThe date of birth entered is not valid. Check to be sure only numeric \n\u00ad\ncharacters in appropriate ranges are entered in the Date of Birth field. The system also should streamline corrective actions.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W. Satzinger, Robert B.

For example, if the \nuser enters an invalid customer ID, the system should tell the user that this has \noccurred and then place the insertion point back in the Customer ID text box. \u275a\n\u275aDesign for Simplicity\nThe final point is the basic KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle. The simpler \nthe user interface, the better the user experience will be. Fewer mouse clicks \nis always more productive. Fewer levels to navigate through increase speed of \naccess. Straightforward paths to highly used forms or pages is best. Developers \nshould always be asking themselves whether there is a simpler way to design the \nnavigation and the screens. Figure 8-12 shows the home page displayed when a customer views the \nRMO Web site. The form includes two menu bars near the top that group \nrelated functions within the same part of the page. If the user points to Shop \nfor Clothing, a submenu is displayed immediately below the menu item and the \nmenu text \u201cShop for Clothing\u201d changes to white text with a blue background.

{"text": "232: PART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Transitioning from Analysis to User-Interface Design\nThe foundation for user-interface design is built from the use case definitions \nas described in Chapter 3. You learned in earlier chapters how to document the \ninteractions between the user and the system using use case descriptions, activ-\nity diagrams, and most importantly system sequence diagrams. Most use cases \nrequire direct user interaction and become the starting point for a dialogue or \nform. Use cases usually require the user to input choices and data into the sys-\ntem (such as when making an online order) or may generate outputs in response \nto a user request (such as when tracking a shipment). \u25a0\n\u25a0Use Cases and the Menu Hierarchy\nMenus provide the mechanisms first to organize use cases and second to invoke \na particular use case or user dialogue. In all but the smallest systems, menus \nare needed to present the user with a number of choices per screen, to group \nrelated functions together so users can more easily locate them, and to properly \nsequence related forms to handle complex procedures. Figure 8-13 shows two \ndifferent menu styles. In Figure 8-13(a), the mouse pointer is positioned over the \nShop item of the upper menu in a Web page. Figure 8-13(b) shows a more com-\nplex menu design, with three menu levels displayed. How does a designer decide which use cases and user interfaces to include, \nwhich menus are required, and how many menu levels are required? These deci-\nsions are driven both by organization of the menus (flat versus deep), by the \nnumber of uses cases or menu choices, and by the limits of human cognition. For a typical business system, dividing the total number of interactive use cases \nby five provides an initial estimate of the number of menus needed that includes \nall use cases and allows for additional menu items, such as setting options or \npreferences. Use cases with common actors and event decomposition or that implement \nCRUD actions for a specific domain class are good candidates to be grouped \ninto a single menu or related group of menus. For example, consider the RMO \nCSMS use cases shown in Figure 8-14.

The number of menu choices ranges from four to \nseven, which won\u2019t overload any one menu and may enable multiple menu levels \nto be displayed at one time. A dialogue design is created for each menu option. You should note that designers often discover missing or incomplete use cases \nduring user-interface design, which results in a brief return to analysis activities \nto complete the documentation. Menus also include options that are not activities or use cases from the event \nlist.

It might be possible to design the three input \nscreens and use those same screens to display the output of the same fields after \nthe system updates internal files. These kinds of decisions are exactly the ones \nthat need to be made during user-interface design. Let\u2019s develop a first draft of an input screen for createNewCustomer \n(name, phones, emails). The first step is to verify the data that is passed. The \nplace to verify the data is to look at the domain model, to see the attributes of \nthe appropriate classes. Observing the domain model (see Figure 4-25), you \ncan see that there are four fields that require input: name, mobilePhone, home-\nPhone, and emailAddress. Notice that there are two other classes, Address \nand Account, that will also be used to verify data for the other \u00ad\nmessages in \nthis use case.

Designers can also document dialogue designs by writing out how the user \nand system might interact if they were two people engaged in conversation. Sometimes, the designer can go right from building a dialogue to sketching a \nseries of screens that make the design more understandable.

{"text": "238: PART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nAs you begin the design of the user interface, there are three major consid-\nerations that will affect your approach. The first decision, which was probably \nmade at the beginning of the project, is whether the application will be built as \na custom, stand-alone software application or whether it will be browser-based. Either approach is viable whether the application is a local, single-computer \napplication or whether it runs over a network or the Internet. If the software is \na stand-alone application, then it will utilize the controls and human-interface \nobjects that are available in development libraries for that platform. If it is a \nbrowser-based application, then it will need to conform to the controls and con-\nfigurations provided by the browsers. In some rare instances, the software may \nneed to support both environments. The second major decision applies to the type of device the application is \ndesigned for. Some applications are designed to run only on desktops and lap-\ntops. Others execute on tablets, while others are designed exclusively to execute \non small devices such as smartphones. In some cases, the software may need to \nrun on multiple devices. In fact, for many types of software, it is desirable that \nit can be executed on several types of devices. Obviously, this complicates the \ndesign of the user interface. The third major decision applies to the operating system platform. For desk-\ntops and laptop computers, the most common operating systems are Windows, \nApple Mac OS, and a UNIX derivation such as Ubuntu. For tablets, there are \nWindows 8 and Windows RT, Apple iOS, Google Android, Amazon Fire, and \nothers such as Ubuntu and BlackBerry. For smartphones, the major operating \nsystems are Google Android, Apple iOS, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, and oth-\ners. This decision affects the design because the human-interface objects that are \navailable are different for each platform, especially for stand-alone applications. For Web-based applications, there is a little more commonality, but the browsers \nare still slightly different for each platform. As with the fundamental principles, the range of topics for this section is \nimmense.

Here are several important guidelines:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDesign screens with purpose. Each screen should have a primary purpose \nor use. Do not clutter the screen with unnecessary elements. Allow empty \nspaces, sometimes called white space, on the screen to keep it simple and \neasily readable. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nConsider location and grouping. Users in the United States read screens top \nto bottom, left to right. Place important items where they are easily found. Make logical groupings of related items and place them closer together. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nEnsure professionalism. Make sure that when people see the screen it looks \nprofessional. Align and organize screen objects. Check for poor grammar \nand spelling errors. Make sure lists have equivalent language constructs \n(nouns or verbs or adjectives\u2014always the same form). Figure 8-19 illustrates a sloppy design of an input form with inconsistent labels, \ninconsistent text box types, poor spacing, misspelled words, and so forth.

The \noverriding objective on data-entry screens is always to minimize errors. The design \nof the screen can have a big influence on whether the data is error free or error \nladen. Errors not only reduce productivity, but also can compound errors when \nthe data is used for later processes. There are many ways to make beautiful, effec-\ntive data input screens. Here are some things to consider as you design the screens:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUse controls that minimize keystrokes. Use controls that do not require \nkeystrokes. List boxes with predefined fields allow quick selection of cor-\nrect data. Date controls where the user can select a date controls entering \ncorrect date and format. Autocorrect fields can also help ensure correct \ndata. Use check boxes and radio boxes when possible. Though these types \nof controls can reduce productivity, they do minimize errors. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nSet focus and tabbing. Set the cursor in the first data-entry box so it is \nready to accept data. Make sure the cursor tabs from field to field in a \n\u00ad\nlogical fashion. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nSet font and text box sizes appropriately. Set font sizes for both labels and \nentered text so that it is easy for the user to read. Set the size of the data-\nentry box so that the use of scroll bars is minimized. It is difficult to enter \nlong sentences into a small text box that requires scrolling to view what \nwas entered. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nInclude online edits. The user interface can be developed to simply accept \nthe entered information, or program code can also be associated with cer-\ntain fields to perform validations immediately. Some edits are simply logi-\ncal and can be made locally. Other edits may require validation against a \ndatabase, and it may not be feasible to perform those edits until the screen \nis submitted. In any event, it is always best to edit the newly entered data as \nthoroughly as possible and as soon as feasible. Figure 8-20 shows a product search screen for RMO. This screen allows the \nuser to search for products using key words and other criteria such as type of \nproducts, price ranges, gender, and catalog.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

Users may be willing to \nwait for a video to begin, but they still prefer rapid responses for the initial load. Furthermore, developers should include sufficient error-handling capability to \nreestablish the dialogue if the connection breaks. The second major issue is that all the pages of the Web site need to be com-\npatible with all of the potential browsers. The most common browsers today \nare Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Each of the major browsers \nimplements the primary controls in a somewhat similar fashion. However, each \nalso has unique extensions. Developers must carefully design and thoroughly \ntest Web pages so that they display correctly in each environment. This could \nrequire either using controls that are common to all browsers, or testing to see \nwhich browser is being used and transmitting the appropriate user-interface \ncode. Here are some additional considerations for design of a Web user interface. \u275a\n\u275aLayout and Formatting\nAs a topic, the layout and formatting of Web pages is extensive. It is impossible \nto address even a small portion of the issues, guidelines, standards, and conven-\ntions that apply to Web user-interface design. Developers who become expert in \nthis arena have a program of continual self-education, reading, and training to \ndesign beautiful, engaging, and effective Web pages. Web applications will be displayed in many different-sized windows. Win-\ndows will also frequently be resized on the computer screen. Careful consid-\neration should be given to what happens to the page as it is resized within the \nwindow. Poorly designed pages may not resize correctly and may require hori-\nzontal scroll bars to view the entire page. Although vertical scrolling is accept-\nable for most applications, horizontal scrolling is not. There is one common business practice that user-interface designers con-\ntinually struggle with: advertising on a Web site. Because the business model \nfor many Web applications includes a revenue string from advertising, designers \nfrequently have to find some way to include sponsor ads. As designers, we will \nnot be able to eliminate all advertising. However, it is a good design practice to \nplace the advertising so that it does not confuse or override the main purpose of \nthe page.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "241: As designers, we will \nnot be able to eliminate all advertising. However, it is a good design practice to \nplace the advertising so that it does not confuse or override the main purpose of \nthe page. This, of course, requires a balance between the revenue stream from \nthe main function of the Web pages and the advertising revenue stream. In contrast to integrated advertising, Figure 8-22 is a Web site of only \nadvertisements. It was an interesting marketing idea, but very difficult for any \nkind of use. \u275a\n\u275aData Entry and User Actions\nData entry for Web applications has all the same considerations as for regular \ndesktop apps. With the advent of such capabilities as client-side programming \nwith asynchronous transmission to the server, data-entry validation can occur \nimmediately as it is entered. A primary consideration for data entry is error han-\ndling when delays occur over the network. \u275a\n\u275aNavigation and Visibility\nStandards and conventions for Web applications are in a continual state of flux. Horizontal menu navigation using tabs along the top of the page are currently a \npopular and effective technique. The guidelines discussed earlier for navigation \nand visibility also apply to Web applications. It is especially important that navi-\ngation links be checked periodically. Web applications frequently have hot links \nto external sites, which are more susceptible to being broken. Figure 8-23 is a draft design for the RMO checkout page. Tasks are clear \nwith easily discernable organization and clear instructions. There is plenty of \nwhite space to allow for additional instructions or navigation elements if needed.

{"text": "243: CHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\nthe earlier principles you learned about multilayer design are not as important \nfor building a smartphone app interface. The principles you will learn in this section apply to creating a smartphone \napplication. However, all smartphones also have browser programs and thus sup-\nport Web-based applications. We won\u2019t discuss them separately, but the same prin-\nciples of effective smartphone app user interfaces apply to the design of Web pages \nviewed on smartphone browsers. Today, all Web-based applications should test \nthe platform that is requesting the page so that it can respond with the appropri-\nate page layout and information. This characteristic is called mobile \u00ad\nresponsive \ndesign. Trying to display a full-bodied Web page on the limited real estate available \non a smartphone screen almost always ends up completely unusable. Two primary characteristics of smartphones that influence every aspect of \nuser-interface design are the limited screen size touch screen interaction. Design-\ning for these two characteristics requires a major shift in thinking. Limited \nscreen size dictates that applications and user interfaces must be simple and \nfocused. In addition, almost all navigation and interaction must fit on and be \ndone through the screen. Smartphones have a very limited repertoire of hard-\nware-based buttons and controls, unlike a desktop with a keyboard that has \nfunction keys and shortcuts as well as a mouse pointer. However, phone interac-\ntion is also changing as voice interaction becomes more common. \u275a\n\u275aLayout and Formatting\nGiven the characteristics of smartphone environment, there are several items \naffecting layout and formatting that should be noted:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEach screen should have a single focus or purpose. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nScreens need both portrait- and landscape-view capabilities. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nWhen appropriate, screens should be allowed to resize without losing \nscreen controls. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nScreen components should be directly touch-manipulated. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nVisible navigation controls should be placed at the bottom of the screen. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nDue to screen swiping, both horizontal and vertical scrolling is allowed. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nUse small pop-up screens when additional information is needed. Figure 8-24 illustrates some of the issues related to smartphone apps. There is always an important tradeoff between the work area of the screen, and \nthe navigation elements. In this case, two types of navigation elements are used.

Confirm all actions that delete data. \u275a\n\u275aNavigation and Visibility\nNavigation and visibility are major issues for smartphone user-interface design. It is generally impossible to keep all navigation controls visible at all times. Developers must pay particular attention to making the application user-friendly \nin this area of design. Here are a few suggested guidelines:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDesign the landing screen (first loading screen) so that it shows clearly how \nthe app is organized and how to get to all the functions. Include a way to \nreturn to this screen on all other screens. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nDesign the user interface so that there are visual clues for where a task is \nlocated in the app. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nConsider using an action bar at the bottom (or top) of every screen with \ncommon navigation or action controls. If the bar must be hidden, make it \neasy to find and show. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nRemember that there is no mouseover capability, so such techniques as tool \ntips are not available. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nEnsure a Back button capability exists, either on the device or as part of the \napplication. Figure 8-25 is the landing screen for the RMO smartphone app. This screen \nis almost completely made up of navigation elements to send the user to the \nappropriate screens. The only image is the small logo at the top. Special atten-\ntion was given to contrast and layout to ensure readability. \u25a0\n\u25a0Tablets\nUser-interface design for tablets requires many of the same techniques that are \nused for smartphone design. Tablets are mobile devices with similar device con-\nstraints as smartphones. The primary difference is that there is more screen real \nestate, so the screen constraints are not as tight. When considering layout and formatting for tablets, applications must sup-\nport both portrait and landscape display. Where a smartphone screen can only \nsupport a single function or activity, it may be possible to have multiple action \nareas on a tablet. The small screen size and the lack of physical keyboards and \nmouse interaction do require that developers still design screen layout carefully. action bar\u2003 a common navigation bar with \naction controls used for smartphones and \n\u00ad\nusually placed at the bottom of the screen\nFigure 8-25 RMO home screen \non a smartphone\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "245: CHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\nData entry and user actions are very similar for tablets and smartphones. The lack of a keyboard makes typing somewhat cumbersome, so any tech-\nnique that reduces actual data entry is helpful. The larger touch screen, how-\never, does permit the use of larger icons and touch areas to alleviate the fat \nfinger problem. Probably the biggest benefit of the somewhat larger screen is that more naviga-\ntion controls and menu items can be made visible and remain on the screen. More \nitems can be added to the action bar, and having navigation controls other than \nthe single action bar is possible. Figure 8-26 is a picture of an iPad with an online \nstore open. The navigation is clear, with a menu on the top and icons for the avail-\nable categories. Note, however, that the site limits this page to eight categories. \u25a0\n\u25a0Designing Reports, Statements, and  \nTurnaround Documents\nDue to the highly interactive nature of today\u2019s software applications, there is \nless need for printing formal reports. In many cases, the screen views that the \nuser sees can either be sent directly to the printer, or a special print view is pro-\nvided. A print view is usually a simple reformatting of the screen view with the \ncontrols, advertising, and extraneous graphics removed. As you work with the \nusers to develop an application, you should continually be asking if a print view \nis required for each screen that displays information or whether a printed report \nis the best form for presenting the information. Modern information systems have made information much more widely \navailable, with a proliferation of all types of reports\u2014paper and electronic. One \nof the major challenges organizations face today is to compile the overwhelming \namount of information available to support managerial decision making. One \nof the most difficult aspects of output design is to decide what information to \nprovide and how to present it effectively.

These contain specific information on business trans-\nactions\u2014for example, a list of all overdue accounts, with each line of the \nreport presenting information about a particular account. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nSummary reports. These are often used to recap periodic activity. An \nexample of this is a daily or weekly summary of all sales transactions, with \na total dollar amount of sales. Managers often use this type of report to \ntrack departmental or division performance. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nException reports. These provide details or summary information about \ntransactions or operating results that fall outside of a predefined range of \nvalues. When business is progressing normally, no report is needed. For \nexample, a manufacturing organization might produce a report that lists \nparts that fail quality control tests more than 0.2 percent of the time. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nExecutive reports.

{"text": "251: CHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\nChapter Summary\nThe primary focus of user-interface design is on the us-\ner\u2019s needs, requiring major involvement by the user. As \nsuch, user-interface design has characteristics of both \nanalysis and design activities. Today\u2019s UI design efforts \nfocus on more than building the screens and reports, \nbut also considers the entire user experience. The use of \nvarious metaphors, such as direct manipulation, desk-\ntop, or dialogue metaphors, helps developers better un-\nderstand and think about how the users interact with \nthe system. User-interface design is a complex discipline and \nusually requires substantial knowledge and experi-\nence to understand important influencing factors. Six \nkey factors to consider are human-interface objects, \nconsistency, discoverability, closure, readability and \nnavigation, and usability and efficiency. Each of these \ncategories has several key issues that need to be ad-\ndressed during design activities. Input for the user interface comes from the dia-\ngrams and models that were developed during the \nanalysis activities. The list of use cases is often helpful \nto define menus and navigation components. Activity \ndiagrams and system sequence diagrams help identify \nparticular screens and reports that are needed. A major difficulty of UI design is the many differ-\nent devices and screen types that must be supported, \nfrom large screen desktop systems to miniature smart-\nphone systems. In addition, many different platforms, \nsuch as Apple versus Android devices, require multiple \ninterfaces to display correctly on each device. Although output reports are not used as widely as they \nonce were, there is still the need to produce printed output \nof some information. Furthermore, today\u2019s printed reports \nneed to be more sophisticated by integrating charts and \ngraphs. Users expect sophisticated electronic reports with \nhot links, which allow drill down to display more detail. discoverability\ndocument metaphor\ndrill down\nexception reports\nexecutive reports\nfeedback\nhuman-computer interaction (HCI)\nhuman-interface objects (HIOs)\nlist box\nmetaphor\nmobile responsive\nradio button\nstoryboarding\nsummary reports\ntext box\ntool tip\nusability\nuser-centered design\nuser experience (UX)\nuser interface (UI)\nvisibility\n\t\n1.

{"text": "258: PART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Overview\nDatabases and database management systems are core components of modern \ninformation systems. Almost every facet of our lives depends on databases. Databases underlie everyday activities, including making a phone call, search-\ning the Web, reading your e-mail, buying groceries, visiting your doctor, and \ntweeting your favorite friends. Database management systems let database \ndesigners, developers, and end users create databases and store, retrieve, and \nmanage the data. Sharing and managing the vast amounts of data needed by \na modern organization wouldn\u2019t be possible without a database management \nsystem. In Chapter 5, you learned to construct a domain model class diagram. The \nclass diagram is the starting point for database development. To design and \nbuild an information system, developers must transform conceptual models into \nmore detailed design models. In this chapter, you will learn how to transform \nthe domain model class diagram into a detailed database model and how to \nimplement that model with a database management system. \u25a0\n\u25a0Databases and Database Management Systems\nA database (DB) is an integrated collection of stored data that is centrally \nmanaged and controlled. A database typically stores information about dozens \nor hundreds of classes or entities. A database is managed and controlled by \na database management system (DBMS). A DBMS is a system software \ncomponent that is generally purchased and installed separately from other \nsystem software components (e.g., operating systems). Examples of modern \ndatabase management systems include Microsoft SQL ServerTM, Oracle, and \nMySQLTM. Opening case\u2002 Downslope Ski Company: A New Production Database\nDownslope Ski Company manufactures skis and snow-\nboards. In the company\u2019s early years, ski manufacturing \nwas simple and straightforward. However, in recent years, \nmanufacturing has become more complex with high-tech \nmaterials, such as carbon-laced resins, and product fea-\ntures, such as skis with integrated bindings. To ensure \nproduct quality, computers now control production pro-\ncesses, including ingredient mixtures, furnace tempera-\ntures, and curing times. These changes have gone hand \nin hand with increased attention to raw materials quality. Downslope uses a just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing \nprocess, which means that it doesn\u2019t stockpile a large \nquantity of raw materials. It keeps about a 10-day supply \non hand and depends on its suppliers to restock materi-\nals at least weekly.

There are sev-\neral areas he wants to review, including data sources, \ndestinations, and formats; data requirements for every \nstep in the manufacturing process; requirements for his-\ntorical data; data size and volume; database response \ntime requirements; and so forth. Input data sources and formats are especially impor-\ntant because suppliers need access to inventory levels, \nincluding both items that are in production and supplies \nthat are on order. They also need to update the data-\nbase for deliveries and billing. Other priorities include \ncapturing and storing data from production furnaces and \nmanufacturing equipment, including periodic outputs of \nvolumes, temperatures, and times. Of course, produc-\ntion staff need access to the database to control pro-\nduction and to forecast future needs.

{"text": "259: CHAPTER 9 \u25a0 Designing the Database\nFigure 9-1 illustrates the components of a typical database. Usually when \nwe refer to a database, we mean both the database data, shown on the left, \nand the DBMS, shown in the middle. The database data consists of two related \ninformation stores: the application domain data, which is the actual data for \nthe problem domain, and the schema, which contains descriptive information \nabout the application domain data. The reason we usually include all of these \ncomponents when we discuss the database is that the application domain data \ncannot be accessed without the DBMS and the schema data. Hence, we consider \nit all together. The schema data is required because it describes the structure and rules for \naccessing the application domain data. It is often referred to as metadata, or \ndata about the data. It includes the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nOrganization of individual stored data items into higher-level groups, such \nas tables\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAssociations among tables (e.g., pointers from customer objects to related \nsale objects)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDetails of individual data items, including types, lengths, locations, and \nindexing of data items\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAccess and content controls, including allowable values for specific data \nitems, value dependencies among multiple data items, and lists of users \nallowed to read or update data items\nA DBMS has four key components: an application programming interface \n(API), a direct SQL or query interface, an administrative interface, and an under-\nlying set of data-access programs and subroutines. Figure 9-1 refers to SQL, \nwhich stands for Structured Query Language SQL, as the query language \nused to access the database data. Application programs, users, and adminis-\ntrators never access the domain data directly. Instead, they tell an appropriate \nDBMS interface what data they need to read or write, using names defined in \nthe schema. The DBMS accesses the schema to verify that the requested data \nexist and that the requesting user has appropriate access privileges. If the request \nis valid, the DBMS extracts information about the physical organization of the \nrequested data from the schema and uses that information to access the domain \ndata on behalf of the requesting program or user.

Phased deployment is normally implemented by deploying various subsys-\ntems one at a time until the entire system has been deployed. Database design is \ninfluenced by both of these techniques. Normally in iterative development, the higher-risk elements of a subsystem \nare developed first. Because the database is the foundation of any information \nsystem, it is common to define the domain model and perform the database \ndesign in the first few iterations of subsystem development. For example, rather \nthan focus on a detailed design of the user interface and on programming in the \nearly iterations, it is usually a better approach to expend time and resources to \ndiscover and validate all the classes and attributes of the domain model. Unfortunately, even this technique may not be sufficient for a complex sys-\ntem consisting of multiple subsystems with interlocking database requirements. Focusing only on a single subsystem within a set of iterations may not discover \nimportant database considerations influenced by the design of other subsystems \nnot yet in development. In a phased deployment, these other subsystems may \nnot be explored until the first subsystem has been deployed. Obviously, if major \nchanges to the database are required, the original deployment may need to be \nredone.

{"text": "263: CHAPTER 9 \u25a0 Designing the Database\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Relational Databases\nHistorically, many different structures have been used to organize data into a \ndatabase. Most early structures were either hierarchical or linked together in \nsome type of network. More recently, however, databases have been built in a \nrelational structure by defining a set of interconnected tables. The following sec-\ntion defines the terms and concepts of relational databases. \u25a0\n\u25a0Definitions\nA relational database management system (RDBMS)  is a DBMS that orga-\nnizes stored data into structures called tables or relations. Relational database \ntables are similar to conventional tables; that is, they are two-dimensional data \nstructures of columns and rows. However, relational database terminology is \nsomewhat different from conventional table and file terminology. A single row \nof a table is called a row, tuple, or record, and a column of a table is called an \n\u00ad\nattribute or field. A single cell in a table is called an attribute value, field value, \nor data element. As indicated previously, the data in a relational database is \nedited and accessed through a common query language called Structured Query \nLanguage or SQL. You will learn how to use SQL in your database courses. Figure 9-3 shows the content of a table as displayed by the Microsoft Access \nrelational DBMS. Note that the first row of the table contains a list of attribute \nnames (column headings) and that the remaining rows contain a collection of \nattribute values, each of which describes a specific product. Each row contains \nthe same attributes in the same order, but not necessarily containing the same \nattribute values.

Create a table for each class in the domain model. 2. Choose a primary key for each table (invent one, if necessary). 3. Add foreign keys to represent one-to-many associations. 4. Create new tables to represent many-to-many associations. 5. Represent and adjust classification hierarchies. 6. Define referential integrity constraints. 7. Evaluate schema quality and make necessary improvements. 8. Choose appropriate data types. 9. Incorporate integrity and security controls. The following subsections discuss these items in more detail. \u275a\n\u275aCreating Tables from Domain Classes\nThe first step in creating a relational database schema is to create a table for \neach class on the class diagram. Figure 9-6 shows a partial class diagram for \nthe RMO customer support system with 17 classes, including three specialized \nclasses of Sale and two of OnlineCart. For the moment, we will treat each group \nof generalized and specialized classes as if it were a single class. Thus, there \nare 12 primary classes that will be used to create tables. The attributes of each \ntable will be the same as those defined for the corresponding class in the class \ndiagram. To avoid confusion, table and attribute names should match the names \nused in the class diagram and abbreviations should be avoided. Initial table defi-\nnitions for the classes in Figure 9-6 are shown in Figure 9-7. This example uses \nthe same camel case naming convention that was used to name the attributes \nin the class diagram. However, there are other conventions that are popular in \nindustry. Some DBMSs allow attribute names with embedded spaces. Other \nconventions include using all lowercase letters with underscores. The examples \nin this book use lowercase attribute names in the domain model and capitalized \ncolumn names in the database schema.

The application program must \nthen retrieve that key for use in subsequent database operations. Embedding \nthis capability in the DBMS frees the Information Systems (IS) developer from \ndesigning and implementing customized key-creation software modules. In the \nexample of Figure 9-8, all the primary keys will be an AutoNumber type of field \nexcept the AccountNumber for the Customer table. An AccountNumber may be \nan AutoNumber field, but it might just as easily be a specific number assigned, \nbased on some other algorithm. Invented keys that aren\u2019t assigned by the information system or DBMS must \nbe carefully scrutinized to ascertain their uniqueness and usefulness over time. For example, employee databases in the United States commonly use Social \nSecurity numbers as keys. Because the U.S. government has a strong interest in \nguaranteeing the uniqueness of Social Security numbers, the assumption that \nthey will always be unique seems safe. But will all employees who are stored \nin the database have a Social Security number? What if the company opens a \nmanufacturing facility in Asia or South America? Invented keys assigned by nongovernmental agencies deserve even more care-\nful scrutiny. For example, FedEx, UPS, and other shipping companies assign a \ntracking number to each shipment they process. Tracking numbers are guaran-\nteed to be unique at any given point in time, but are they guaranteed to be unique \nforever (i.e., are they ever reused)? Could reuse of a tracking number cause pri-\nmary key duplication in your database? And what would happen if two different \nshippers assigned the same tracking number to two different shipments? Organizations that have large number of records in the database and that \nshare these items across multiple databases will sometimes use a globally unique \nidentifier (GUID). GUIDs are guaranteed to be unique across all items in the \nworld. However, because they are usually 32 hexadecimal digits in length, they \nrequire substantial storage space in the database, and are usually only used for \nspecific items that need to be uniquely identified outside of the database. \u275a\n\u275aRepresenting Associations\nAssociations are represented within a relational database by foreign keys. The \nchoice of which foreign keys to place in which tables depends on the type of \nassociation being represented.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Software Quality Attributes", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

Figure 9-11 shows the definition of the Sale table under the first method. All \nthe non-key attributes in the InStoreSale, TelephoneSale, and OnlineSale classes \nare stored in the Sale table. For any particular sale, some of the attribute values in \neach row will be empty or, in database terminology, NULL. For example, a row \nrepresenting a telephone sale would have no values for the attributes StoreID, \nRegisterID, TimeOnSite, and ChatUse. Figure 9-12 shows separate table definitions for specialized classes. The \nrelationship among Sale, InStoreSale, TelephoneSale, and OnlineSale is repre-\nsented by the foreign key SaleID in all three specialized class tables.

In addition, some-\ntimes developers will design a database without using a complete data model. In any event, it is a good practice to do a final review of the database, to \nensure that it is well formed and correct.

Allows flexibility in implementing future data model changes\n2. Contains a minimum of redundant data\n3. Prevents insertion, deletion, and update anomalies\nA database schema is considered flexible and maintainable if changes to the \ndatabase schema can be made with minimal disruption to existing data content \nand structure. For example, adding a new class to the schema shouldn\u2019t require \nredefining existing tables. Adding a new one-to-many association should only \nrequire adding new foreign keys and/or tables. Redundancy also plays a role in \ndatabase longevity and usability. Excessive redundancy reduces schema flexibility \nand also reduces system performance. Anomalies in record updates, insertions, and \ndeletions occur, for example, when deleting data in a table inadvertently deletes \nimportant but ancillary data. For example, if customer name and address informa-\ntion is maintained as part of a Sale, then deleting a Sale record might also com-\npletely delete the Customer information! Obviously, this is not a desirable result. You have learned how to create a database schema based on a data modeling \nactivity rigorous enough to create a correct and complete data model. You have \nalso learned how to convert a conceptual data model to a relational model or rela-\ntional database schema. The advantage of creating a database schema using this \nprocess is that the resulting schema is already in normalized form. However, in \nyour career you will have occasion to work with databases that were not designed \nwith this rigorous data modeling approach or in which data modeling errors were \nmade, so you should understand how to evaluate and normalize a database. Normalization is a formal technique for structuring a database to minimize \ndata redundancy and to prevent data anomalies. It defines specific methods to \neliminate redundancy and improve flexibility as well as to prevent data anomalies. Database theory defines increasing levels of normalization, including first normal \nform, second normal form, third normal form, fourth normal form, Boyce-Codd \nnormal form, and others; however, a complete discussion of normalization is well \nbeyond the scope of this textbook.

To test RegularPrice attribute, these \nstatements are:\nRegularPrice is functionally dependent on PromotionID if for each value \nof PromotionID there is only one corresponding value of Regular Price. RegularPrice is functionally dependent on ProductItemID if for each value \nof ProductItemID there is only one corresponding value of Regular Price. If either statement is true\u2014that is, an attribute is functionally dependent on \nonly part of the key\u2014then a 2NF violation exists. In this example, the first state-\nment is false, but the second is true. RegularPrice depends on ProductItemID \nregardless of what promotions, if any, a product participates in. Another way \nto think about this example is to think about the underlying association repre-\nsented by the PromoOffering table. A product can be part of multiple promo-\ntions at the same time. Although a product\u2019s promotional price can be different \nin different promotions, its regular price is the same whether it participates in \none promotion, three promotions, or none. If a non-key attribute such as RegularPrice is functionally dependent on \nonly part of the primary key, then you must remove the non-key attribute from \nits present table and place it in another table to satisfy the requirements of \n2NF. Because the first functional dependency statement is true, RegularPrice \nbelongs in a table that has ProductItemID as its primary key. If such a table \ndoesn\u2019t already exist, it must be created. However, in this case, there is \nalready a table with ProductItemID as its primary key: the ProductItem table. Thus, the column RegularPrice is removed from the PromoOffering table and \nadded to the ProductItem table, thus ensuring that the PromoOffering table \nis in\u00a02NF. Referring back to Figure 9-6, notice that the PromoOffering class was \nmodeled incorrectly.

Obviously, this is a complex decision that requires careful analysis of \nthe data requirements for each location. Configuration decisions must consider \nsuch things as frequency of queries versus updates; size and frequency of result \nsets; data transmission costs; physical location of server farms; and many other \ncost, efficiency, and performance requirements. The following sections briefly \nconsider four distribution strategies:\n1. Data replication\n2. Horizontal partitioning\n3. Vertical partitioning\n4. Combinations of the above three strategies\n\u275a\n\u275aData Replication\nComplete database copies are hosted at each location or server farm and main-\ntained by cooperating DBMSs. The servers are usually distributed across geo-\ngraphic locations. Application programs can access any server and usually make \ndatabase updates to only one server. Servers at distinct locations periodically \nexchange update information to synchronize their database copies. Applications can direct access requests to any available server, with prefer-\nence given to the nearest server. When a server is unavailable, clients can redi-\nrect requests to another available server.

{"text": "281: CHAPTER 9 \u25a0 Designing the Database\ndatabase servers do have some drawbacks. When data are updated on one data-\nbase copy, clients accessing that same data from another database copy receive \nan outdated response. To counteract this problem, each database copy must \nperiodically be updated with changes from other database servers. This process \nis called database synchronization. The time delay between an update to a database copy and the propaga-\ntion of that update to other database copies is an important database design \ndecision. During the time between the original update and the update of data-\nbase copies, application programs that access outdated copies aren\u2019t receiv-\ning responses that reflect current reality. Designers can address this problem \nby synchronizing more frequently or continuously. However, synchronization \nthen consumes a substantial amount of database server capacity, and a large \namount of network capacity among the related database servers must be pro-\nvided. The proper synchronization strategy is a complex trade-off among cost, \nhardware and network capacity, and the need of application programs and \nusers for current data. The advantage of replicated distributed databases is that each location is \nessentially independent for any given query or update; thus, response times tend \nto be fast. Also, in case of unavailability for any location, the other locations \nare immediately prepared to handle queries. In addition, transaction process-\ning, which requires multiple updates to occur, is straightforward because only \none location is impacted. The two major disadvantages are the increased storage \nrequirements because the database is duplicated multiple times, and, as men-\ntioned previously, keeping all the locations synchronized. \u275a\n\u275aHorizontal Partitioning\nHorizontal partitioning of the database occurs when a table is split by storing \nsome rows or records at one location and other rows or records at another loca-\ntion. For example, suppose a large international bank had branches around the \nworld with one data center in the United States, a second data center in Canada, \na third data center in Europe, and so forth. It would make sense to partition the \nCustomerAccount tables, summary, and detail information horizontally so that \nthe data for U.S. customers resided in the U.S. data center. Figure 9-23 illustrates \na global view one of the CustomerAccount tables, showing how it might be par-\ntitioned. The global schema will identify which records reside at which location \nso queries and updates can be routed to the correct data center.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Software Quality Attributes"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "282: PART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nThe major advantage of this configuration is its simplicity. Each data center \nis essentially independent and database access can be optimized as though it \nwere a local data center. Security is also handled at the local level. A disad-\nvantage is that, because there is no duplication, this configuration is subject to \nunavailability should one of the locations experience a catastrophe. \u275a\n\u275aVertical Partitioning\nVertical partitioning of the database occurs when complete tables or only specific \ncolumns of a base table are stored at distinct locations. A vertically partitioned \ntable may have some columns at location A, other columns at location B, and \nother columns at location C. Distributing entire base tables to distinct locations \nis fairly straightforward. Distributing only columns of the same table to distinct \nlocations is more complex, and is more complex than horizontal partitioning. So \nwhen would an organization implement vertical partitioning? Figure 9-24 illustrates vertical partitions for an AssemblyPart table in a \nSupply Chain database for a company that obtains parts from manufacturers \nin one location, such as Japan, and does final inspection and assembly of those \nparts in another location, such as the United States. For the AssemblyPart table \nin Japan, information is required about the description, the manufacturer, and \nthe quantity on hand of these raw parts. For the AssemblyPart table in the United \nStates, information is required about the description, the schematic number of \nthe assembly instructions, the document number of the inspection instructions, \nand the quantity on hand at the assembly plant. Thus, vertical partitioning of \nthe database occurs more frequently when different functional areas must access \nthe same database and the same data elements. \u275a\n\u275aCombination of Replication, Horizontal, and Vertical Partitions\nAll of the preceding three techniques can be combined to provide the right data \nat the right place in the right form. A large international organization will often \nhave different functional areas located at distinct geographical locations, requir-\ning vertical partitioning. Other functional areas, such as Sales, may require cus-\ntomer and sales information at all locations, which may best be partitioned in \na horizontal configuration. Some information, such as corporate-wide informa-\ntion, may need to be available at all locations and may utilize replicated tables.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Software Quality Attributes"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

Corporate headquarters relies on \nthe central database server in the data center. The primary advantages of this architecture are fault tolerance and reduced \nWAN capacity requirements. Each location could continue to operate indepen-\ndently if the central database server failed. However, as the remote locations \ncontinued to operate, their database contents would gradually drift out of \nsynchronization. The primary disadvantages to the distributed architecture are cost and com-\nplexity. The architecture saves WAN costs through reduced capacity require-\nments, but adds costs for additional database servers. The cost of acquiring, \noperating, and maintaining the additional servers would probably be much \nhigher than the cost of adding greater WAN capacity. So, does the proposed architecture make sense for RMO? The answer \ndepends on some data that hasn\u2019t yet been gathered and on answers to some \nquestions about desired system performance, tolerances for downtime, cost \nand reliability of WAN connections, and the cost and availability of cloud \nservices. RMO management must also determine its goals for system perfor-\nmance and\u00a0reliability. The distributed architecture would provide higher per-\nformance\u00a0and reliability but at substantially increased cost. Management must \ndetermine whether the extra cost is worth the expected benefits. \u25a0\n\u25a0Protecting the Database\nIn Chapter 6, you learned about the need to consider security issues early in the \ndevelopment of the new system. In the discussion of access controls in \u00ad\nChapter\u00a06, \nyou learned about the process of authentication and authorization. Those con-\ncepts apply directly to the protection of the data in the database and are used \nextensively before allowing access to the database. Additional techniques, such \nas data encryption, are also a frequently used technique to keep the data pro-\ntected from unauthorized persons and programs. The responsibility for designing and deploying a secure database is shared \nbetween the project team, that is, the system development team, and the DBA. The DBA provides advice and direction to the project team as they design the \nnew system to ensure that proper controls and mechanisms are included in \nthe\u00a0code of the new system. The DBA then has responsibility for protecting the \nDBMS and the database when it is put into production and while it is opera-\ntional.", "domains": ["Software Quality Attributes"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

In Figure 9-1, you see that there are three types of agents that have access \nto the database: the application programs, database users, and database admin-\nistrators. The development team plays a major role in the security aspects of the \napplication programs. The DBA is concerned about security for all three types \nof agents.

Protecting the database is a serious issue in the development and deployment of \ninformation systems, and a thorough treatment of the subject is well beyond the \nscope of this textbook. There are many books and even university courses that \ncover security for information systems, networks, and databases. In addition to the security issues for protecting the database, there is the \nneed to protect the data in the database from catastrophes ranging from sim-\nple power outages to major natural disasters.

He accesses the record that con-\ntains shoe inventory levels. It indicates that there are 10 pairs in stock. Gary also \nwants to buy the same shoes, and also reads the shoe information.

Finally, some specific \nAgile system development methodologies are described, including Agile Unified \n\u00ad\nProcess, Extreme Programming, and Scrum. \u25a0\n\u25a0The System Development Life Cycle\nChapter 1 demonstrated how analysis and design models and techniques are \nused to solve business problems by building an information system. For prob-\nlem-solving work to be productive, it needs to be organized and goal-oriented. Analysts achieve these results by organizing the work into projects. As defined \nin Chapter 1, a project is a planned undertaking, with a beginning and end that \nproduces a well-defined result or product. The term information system devel-\nopment project refers to a planned undertaking that produces a new information \nsystem. Some system development projects are very large, requiring thousands \nof hours of work by many people and spanning several calendar years. In the \nRMO case study introduced in Chapter 2, the system being developed is a mod-\nerately sized computer-based information system requiring a moderately sized \nproject. Many system development projects are smaller, lasting a few months. Some are very small, such as the Tradeshow application in Chapter 1. For a system development project to be successful, it must be planned and \norganized. The plan must include a comprehensive set of activities that flow in \nthe proper sequence. Otherwise, activities are omitted or work may need to be \ndone multiple times. The end result, of course, is producing a high-quality infor-\nmation system as measured by its reliability, robustness, efficiency, and fitness \nfor purpose. The system development life cycle (SDLC), which was introduced in \nChapter 1, is a fundamental concept in the success of information system devel-\nopment projects. The SDLC provides a way to think about the development of a new system \nas a progressive process, much like a living entity. This concept can be expanded \nand you can view the information system as having a life itself; in fact, we often \nrefer to the life cycle of a system.

As software is developed, team members must confirm that the system vision \nstill matches user expectations or that the technology will work as planned. Sometimes, prototypes are discarded after proving that point. Elaboration Phase\u2003 The elaboration phase usually involves several iterations, and \nearly iterations typically complete the identification and definition of all the sys-\ntem requirements. Because the UP is an adaptive approach to development, the \nrequirements are expected to evolve and change after work starts on the project. The elaboration phase\u2019s iterations also complete the analysis, design, and \nimplementation of the system\u2019s core architecture. Usually, the aspects of the \nsystem that pose the greatest risk are identified and implemented first. Until \ndevelopers know exactly how the highest-risk aspects of the project will work \nout, they can\u2019t determine the amount of effort required to complete the project. By the end of the elaboration phase, the project manager should have more real-\nistic estimates for the project\u2019s cost and schedule, and the business case for the \nproject can be confirmed. Remember that the design, implementation, and test-\ning of key parts of the system are completed during the elaboration phase. One \nother major objective of the elaboration phase is to do the necessary research \nand fact-finding so all the user requirements are identified. During the elabora-\ntion phase, a high percentage of time is spent on understanding and analysis. Construction Phase\u2003 The construction phase involves several iterations that con-\ntinue the design and implementation of the system. The core architecture and \nhighest-risk aspects of the system are already complete. Now the focus of the work \nturns to the routine and predictable parts of the system\u2014for example, detailing \nthe system controls, such as data validation, fine-tuning the user-interface design, \nfinishing routine data maintenance functions, and completing the help and user \npreference functions.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

In this type of environment, changes are so numerous that \nprojects can bog down and never reach completion. Scrum excels in this type \nof\u00a0situation. Scrum focuses primarily on the team level. It is a type of social engineering \nthat emphasizes individuals more than processes and describes how teams of \ndevelopers can work together to build software in a series of short mini-projects. Key to this philosophy is the complete control a team exerts over its own organi-\nzation and its work processes. Software is developed incrementally, and controls \nare imposed empirically\u2014by focusing on things that can be accomplished. The basic control mechanism for a Scrum project is a list of all the things \nthe system should include and address. This list\u2014called the product backlog \nincludes user functions (such as use cases), features (such as security), and tech-\nnology (such as platforms). The product backlog list is continually being pri-\noritized, and only a few of the high-priority items are worked on at a time, \naccording to the current needs of the project and its sponsor. \u275a\n\u275aScrum Organization\nThe three main organizational elements that affect a Scrum project are the \nproduct owner, the Scrum master, and the Scrum team or teams. The product owner is the client, but he or she has additional responsi-\nbilities. Remember that in Agile development, the user and client are closely \ninvolved in the project. In Scrum, the product owner maintains the product \nbacklog list. For any function to be included in the final system, it must first \nbe placed on the product backlog. Because the product owner maintains that \nlist, any request must first be approved and agreed to by the product owner. In \ntraditional development projects, the project team initiates the interviews and \nother activities to identify and define requirements. In a Scrum project, the pri-\nmary client controls the requirements. This forces the client and user to be inti-\nmately involved in the project. Nothing can be accomplished until the product \nowner creates the backlog. The Scrum master enforces Scrum practices and helps the team complete its \nwork.

These \nrequirements can be prioritized by using several criteria, including importance \nto the business, risk, complexity, size, and other dependencies. In most proj-\nects, some combination of these criteria is used to prioritize the requirements. \u00ad\nFigure\u00a011-4 also indicates that the project team has made a preliminary assign-\nment of these requirements to iterations.

As\u00a0was noted earlier in the chapter, establishing such things as strong executive \nsupport, clear business case and direction, and effective planning is critical to \nproject success. These important factors are identified and resolved during the \nactivities of Core Process 1. Figure 11-5 highlights the four activities associated \nwith Core Process 1. \u25a0\n\u25a0Identify the Problem\nInformation systems development projects are initiated for various reasons, \nincluding (1) to respond to an opportunity, (2) to resolve a problem, and (3) to \nrespond to an external directive. Most companies are continually looking for ways to increase their market \nshares or open up new markets. One way they create opportunities is with stra-\ntegic plans\u2014short term and long term. In many ways, planning is the optimal \nway to identify new projects. As the strategic plans are developed, projects are \nidentified, prioritized, and scheduled. Projects are also initiated to resolve immediate business problems. Such \nprojects can be initiated as part of a strategic plan, but they are more com-\nmonly requested by middle managers who want to take care of some difficulty \nin the company\u2019s operations. Sometimes, these needs are so critical that they are \nbrought to the attention of the strategic planning committee and integrated into \nthe overall business strategy. At other times, an immediate need can\u2019t wait, such \nas a new sales commission schedule or a new report needed to assess productiv-\nity. In these cases, managers of business functions will request the initiation of \nindividual development projects. Finally, projects are initiated to respond to outside directives. One common \nversion of this is legislative changes that require new information gathering and \nreporting\u2014for example, changes in tax laws and labor laws. Legislative changes \ncan also expand or contract the range of services and products that an organiza-\ntion can offer in a market. For example, recent changes in health insurance with \nthe Affordable Care Act have required insurance companies to modify exist-\ning systems and add new systems to interface with government systems and the \nHealth Insurance Marketplace.

In some cases, the scope and approach of the project may need \nto be changed to ameliorate technological risk. The important point is that a \nrealistic assessment will identify technological risks early, making it possible to \nimplement corrective measures. \u275a\n\u275aAssess Resource Risks and Feasibility\nThe project management team must also assess the availability of resources for \nthe project. The primary resource consists of team members. Development proj-\nects require the involvement of systems analysts, system technicians, and users. Required people may not be available to the team at the necessary times. An \nadditional risk is that people assigned to the team may not have the necessary \nskills for the project. After the team is functioning, members may have to leave \nthe team. This threat can come either from staff who are transferred within \nthe organization if other special projects arise or from qualified team members \nwho are hired by other organizations. Although the project manager usually \ndoesn\u2019t like to think about these possibilities, skilled people are in short supply \nand sometimes do leave projects. The other resources required for a successful project include adequate com-\nputer resources, physical facilities, and support staff. Generally, these resources \ncan be made available, but the schedule can be affected by delays in the avail-\nability of these resources. \u275a\n\u275aIdentify Schedule Risks and Feasibility\nThe development of a project schedule always involves high risk. Every sched-\nule requires many assumptions and estimates without adequate information. For \nexample, the needs (and, hence, the scope) of the new system aren\u2019t well known. Also, the time needed to research and finalize requirements has to be estimated. The availability and capability of team members aren\u2019t completely known. Another frequent risk in developing the schedule occurs when upper man-\nagement decides that the new system must be deployed within a certain time. Sometimes, there is an important business reason for setting a fixed deadline, \nsuch as RMO\u2019s need to complete the CSS in time for online ordering over the \nholidays. Similarly, universities require the completion of new systems before \nkey dates in the university schedule. For example, if a new admissions system \nisn\u2019t completed before the admissions season, then it might as well wait another \nfull year.", "domains": ["Software Quality Attributes"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

User documents, such as sample invoices, were scanned and placed in a doc-\nument repository. User functional definitions were recorded in a forum system. Using a forum allowed team members and users to update it when key issues \nwere discussed and needed to be remembered. Sample screen and report layouts \nwere either sketched out or drawn with Visio or Keynote. Hand sketches were \noften scanned and saved. Most design decisions and specifications went right \ninto the program code and weren\u2019t documented. However, some decisions were \nglobal, and those were captured in a wiki.

It is a process by which a set of detailed \nobject-oriented design models are built, which are then used by the program-\nmers to write and test programs for the new system. Systems design is the bridge \nbetween user requirements and programming the new system. One strength of \nthe object-oriented approach is that the design models are often just extensions \nof the requirements models. Obviously, it is much easier to extend an existing \nmodel than to create entirely new design models. Frequently, developers like to \nskip the design model step; however, it is a good practice to create design models \nand not just jump into coding. Just as a builder doesn\u2019t build something larger \nthan a doghouse or a shed without a set of blueprints, a good system developer \nwould never try to develop a large system without a set of design models. One tenet of Agile, adaptive development approaches emphasized through-\nout this text is to create models only if they have meaning and are necessary. Sometimes, new developers misinterpret this guideline to mean that they don\u2019t \nneed to develop design models at all.

{"text": "368: PART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nAn object-oriented program consists of sets of computing objects. Each \nobject has data and program logic encapsulated within itself. Analysts define \nthe structure of the program logic and data fields by defining a class. The class \ndefinition describes the structure or a template of what an executing object \nlooks like. The object itself doesn\u2019t come into existence until the program begins \nto execute. This is called an instantiation of the class\u2014that is, making an \ninstance (an object) based on the template provided by the class definition. An object-oriented program consists of a set of these instantiated objects \nthat cooperate to accomplish a result. These objects work together by sending \neach other messages and working in concert to support the functions of the \nmain program. Figure 12-1 depicts how an object-oriented program works. The program \nincludes a window object that displays a form in which to enter a student ID and \nother information (message 1). From the user perspective, this object appears as \na form on a screen. After the student ID is entered, the Window object sends a \nmessage (message 2) to the Student class to tell it to create a new Student object \n(instance) in the program. The new Student object will know that it needs more \ndata for some of its attributes based on internal logic in the student class, so it \nwill send a message to a Database Access object asking for data from the data-\nbase (message 3). Once it is completely instantiated with all the required data, \nthe Student object sends the information back to the Window object to display \nit on the screen. The student user then enters the updates to her personal infor-\nmation (message 4), and another sequence of messages is sent to update the Stu-\ndent object in the program, which forwards information to the Database Access \nobject and writes it to the database. The important concept you should understand is that an object-oriented \nprogram consists of many objects. Within each object, the program logic exists \nFigure 12-1 Object-oriented \nevent-driven program flow\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\ninstantiation\u2003 creation of an object \nbased on the template provided by the \nclass\u00a0definition\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "374: PART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nAn object-oriented system designer must provide enough detail so a pro-\ngrammer can write the initial class definitions, including the method code. The \nfollowing sections and Chapter 13 explain these models in more depth and \nexplain how to use them to perform detailed design. \u25a0\n\u25a0Steps of Object-Oriented Design\nThe previous section identified the primary models used for object-oriented \ndesign and the source models from analysis activities. As you saw in Figure\u00a012-1, \nan object-oriented program will have classes in three separate layers: user inter-\nface, problem domain, and database access layers. Thus, object-oriented \ndesign is the process that identifies and describes the classes within each layer \nand defines the messages that are used to invoke the methods of the involved \nclasses. Object-oriented design is an analytical, rigorous, and detailed process. Don\u2019t be discouraged if it takes several tries before you feel comfortable with \nthis skill. Another important issue about object-oriented design is that it is \u201cuse-case-\ndriven.\u201d As was discussed earlier, a programmer will code all of the methods \nacross various classes that are required to implement the flow of execution of a \nsingle use case. Object-oriented design is done the same way. A single use case \nis chosen and the appropriate models are constructed or updated to describe the \ndetails of the use case. Note in the definition of object-oriented design, it empha-\nsizes this fact of being use-case-driven. Because the process of object-oriented design is quite rigorous, sometimes \ndevelopers are tempted to skip the design step and move directly to program-\nming. In fact, with simple use cases, at times it is easier just to code the use case, \nrather than develop a formal use case design. As has been discussed earlier with \nAgile development, the objective of development activities should always be to \ncreate accurate, robust software. If a model or diagram will assist in that objec-\ntive, then it should be created. If it does not contribute directly to the end result, \nthen time should not be spent on it. However, you should not just skip modeling \nwith the assumption that a model is a distraction rather than a necessary step in \ncreating a solid design for the software.

The middle path, using communication dia-\ngrams, can be used for use cases that are more complex. The path on the right, \nusing sequence diagrams, can be used for any use case, no matter the level of \ncomplexity. No matter which technique is used, detailed design does require a \ncareful thought process to ensure a solid, well-constructed solution. In any of the three techniques for modeling, the objective is to identify and \ndefine the methods that are required in each class. The final design class dia-\ngram documents these required methods. It should be noted that each use case \nwill have a separate sequence diagram or communication diagram. Furthermore, \nthe design class diagram is a growing model because as each use case design is \nfinished, the new methods are added to the existing design class diagram.

Finally, a package diagram can also be added to divide the classes into \ncomponents or subsystems that can be implemented as a unit. Some develop-\ners use package diagrams, but many do not.

{"text": "376: PART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Design Classes and the Design Class Diagram\nThe design class diagram contains the final definition of each class in the final \nobject-oriented software system. The primary source of information for this dia-\ngram is the problem domain model. Hence, the problem domain model serves \nas the basis for both database design, as you learned in Chapter 9, and for \nthe software classes as defined in the design class diagram. First, you need to \nunderstand the diagram itself, and then you\u2019ll learn how it is created during the \ndesign\u00a0process. The domain model class diagram shows a set of problem domain classes and \ntheir associations. During analysis, because it is a discovery process, analysts \ngenerally don\u2019t worry much about the details of the attributes. However, because \nin object-oriented programming the attributes of a class must be declared as \npublic or private and each attribute must also be defined by its type, such as \ncharacter or numeric, it is important to elaborate on these details as well as \nto define the methods and parameters that are passed to the methods and the \nreturn values from methods. As developers build the design class diagrams, they add many more classes \nthat were not originally defined in the domain model. Referring to Figure 12-1, \nthe Input window objects and Database access objects are examples of addi-\ntional classes that are not problem domain classes. The classes in a system can \nbe partitioned into distinct categories, such as user-interface classes or data \naccess classes. At times, designers may also develop distinct class diagrams by \nsubsystem. The following section now turns to design class diagram notation \nand discusses the design principles used in developing the first iteration of the \ndesign class diagram. \u25a0\n\u25a0Design Class Stereotypes\nUML doesn\u2019t specifically distinguish between design class notation and domain \nmodel class diagram notation. However, practical differences occur simply \nbecause the objective of design modeling is distinct from that of domain model-\ning. Domain modeling shows things in the users\u2019 work environment and the \nnaturally occurring associations among them. At that point, the classes aren\u2019t \nspecifically software classes.

{"text": "376: At that point, the classes aren\u2019t \nspecifically software classes. After you start a design class diagram, though, you \nare specifically defining software classes. Because many different types of design \nclasses are identified during the design process, UML has a special \u00ad\nnotation\u2014\ncalled a stereotype\u2014that allows designers to designate a special type of class. A stereotype is simply a way to categorize a model element as a certain type. A stereotype extends the basic definition of a model element by indicating that \nit has some special characteristic you want to highlight. The notation for a ste-\nreotype is the name of the type placed within printer\u2019s guillemets, like this: \n\u00abcontrol\u00bb. Four types of design classes are considered standard stereotypes: an entity \nclass, a boundary or view class, a controller class, and a data access class. \u00ad\nFigure\u00a012-9 shows the notation used to identify these four stereotypes. An entity class is the design stereotype for a problem domain class. It typi-\ncally describes something users deal with when doing their work. Objects of \nentity classes usually need to be remembered and are also referred to as persis-\ntent classes. A persistent class is an entity stereotyped class with objects that \nexist after the program quits. However, persistency is usually not indicated as a \nstereotype. The way to make data persistent is to write it to a file or database so \nthat it is saved and can be retrieved at a later execution of the software.

So a boundary stereotype is either a user or a system \ninterface class. A controller class mediates between the boundary classes and the entity \nclasses. In other words, its responsibility is to catch the messages from the bound-\nary class objects and send them to the correct entity class objects. It acts as a \nkind of switchboard between the boundary or view layer and the domain\u00a0layer. A data access class is used to retrieve data from and send data to a data-\nbase.

Here are a few general guidelines:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nOne-to-many associations that indicate a superior/subordinate relationship are \nusually navigated from the superior to the subordinate\u2014for example, from \nSale to SaleItem. Sometimes, these relationships form hierarchies of navigation \nchains\u2014for example, from Promotion to ProductItem to InventoryItem. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nMandatory associations, where objects in one class can\u2019t exist without \nobjects of another class, are usually navigated from the independent class to \nthe dependent class\u2014for example, from Customer to Sale. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nWhen an object needs information from another object, a navigation arrow \nmight be required, pointing either to the object itself or to its parent in a \nhierarchy. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nNavigation visibility arrows may be bidirectional\u2014for example, a Sale \nobject might need to send a message to its Customer object as well as \nthe\u00a0reverse. The very first step you do when creating the first-cut design class diagram \nis to add a controller class. You will learn more about controller classes in the \nnext chapter. Basically, the controller class is a switchboard between the input \nscreens and the programming logic classes, i.e. the domain classes, for a par-\nticular use case. In our examples, we will always create a controller class for \neach use case, and place it between the user-interface classes and the problem \ndomain classes. Figure 12-14 is a first-cut design class diagram for the use case Create tele-\nphone sale based on the steps described earlier: add a controller class, elaborate \nattributes, and identify navigation visibility. To elaborate the attributes, you add \ntype information and visibility. To add navigation visibility, you first identify \nwhich classes may be involved and then determine the classes that require navi-\ngation visibility to other classes. For example, for the Create telephone sale use \ncase, price information is in the PromoOffering class and description informa-\ntion is in the ProductItem class. In most instances, it is unnecessary to put the \nnavigation visibility reference attribute in the class. (And, in fact, there are some \nlanguages that do not require it.)

Also, on the back of each card, write the \npertinent information about required attributes of each object class. 4. Another helpful step is to include the user-interface classes. If a user is \npart of the team and if some preliminary work has been done on the user-\ninterface requirements, it could be effective to add CRC cards for all user-\ninterface window classes that are required for the use case. By including \nuser-interface classes, all the input and output forms can be included in the \ndesign, making it much more complete. 5. Add any other required utility classes that are needed to the solution. For \nexample, for a three-layer design, data access classes will be part of the \nsolution. Usually, each persistent domain class will have a data access class \nto read and write to the database. At the end of this process, you will have a small set of CRC cards that col-\nlaborate to support the use case.

The primary class responsible for creating a new customer account could \nbe the Customer class, so we will add a CRC card for Customer. It makes \nsense that a Customer class takes responsibility for creating and updat-\ning anything having to do with customer details such as accounts and \naddresses. The Customer class also has the responsibility to instantiate a \nnew object with a constructor method. Some developers like to include \nconstructor responsibilities, while others do not. In our example, we will \nnot include the constructor. The programmers will know that every class \nrequires at least one constructor. The input information for the constructor \ncan be found in the SSD, as shown in Figure 5-10. Figure 12-18 illustrates \nthe completion of step 2. 3. For the third step, we observe from Figure 5-4 and Figure 5-10 that there \nare two other messages coming into the system. One message passes \naddress data and another message passes credit card information. Also \nnote in Figure 12-16 that there are two other classes involved in this use \ncase, Address and Account. When creating a new customer, the system \nalso needs to instantiate a new Account object, and at least one new \nAddress object, though there may also be multiple address objects created. \u00ad\nFigure\u00a012-19 illustrates the completion of step 3, except for the attributes, \nwhich are not being shown in this example. 4.

A second input screen will allow enter-\ning address information, multiple times if necessary. A final input screen \nwill accept credit card information. Because there may be extra processing \nrequired to verify credit information at that point, the user wanted to have \nit on a separate input screen.

In other words, they \nindicate the \u201cgoodness\u201d of the detailed design and the implementation of the \nnew system. Although understanding and using the following design principles \nwill not guarantee a high-quality design, applying these principles will increase \nthe probability that the design is solid. Ignoring the following principles will \nalmost certainly ensure a less-than-optimal software design. The following discussion of good design principles is a launching point for \nyou to understand how to design high-quality software. However, it is not a \ncomprehensive discussion. There are many good books and articles on the prin-\nciples of good object-oriented design, which further explain principles and tech-\nniques of good design. \u25a0\n\u25a0Object Responsibility\nOne of the most fundamental principles of object-oriented design is the idea of \nobject responsibility; that is, objects should be responsible for carrying out \nsystem processing. These responsibilities are categorized in two major areas: \nknowing and doing. In other words, what is an object expected to know and \nwhat is an object expected to do or to initiate?

{"text": "390: PART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nKnowing includes an object\u2019s responsibilities for knowing about its own \ndata and knowing about other classes with which it must collaborate to carry \nout use cases. Obviously, a class should know about its own data, what attri-\nbutes exist, and how to maintain the information in those attributes. It should \nalso know where to go to get information when required. For example, dur-\ning the instantiation of an object, data that aren\u2019t passed as parameters may be \nrequired. An object should know about or have navigation visibility for other \nobjects that can provide the required information. For example, in Figure 12-2, \nthe first constructor method for the Student class doesn\u2019t receive a studentID \nvalue as a parameter. Instead, the Student class takes responsibility for creat-\ning a new studentID. It will know how to create a studentID according to an \ninternal algorithm, such as an \u201cautonumber next higher number\u201d algorithm, or \nperhaps a globally unique identifier routine. Doing includes all the activities an object performs to complete a use case. Some of those activities include receiving and processing messages. Another \nactivity is to instantiate, or create, new objects that may be required for comple-\ntion of a use case. Classes must collaborate to carry out a use case, and some \nclasses are responsible for coordinating the collaboration. For example, in the \nuse case Create phone sale, the Sale class has responsibility to create SaleItem \nobjects. Another class, such as InventoryItem, is only responsible for provid-\ning information about itself. Good design dictates that the developer pay close \nattention to recognizing and assigning responsibilities to the appropriate objects. \u25a0\n\u25a0Separation of Responsibilities or Separation of Concerns\nSeparation of responsibilities, also called separation of concerns, is a design \nprinciple that is applied to a group of classes rather than to each class indi-\nvidually. The basic idea of separation of responsibilities is to segregate classes \ninto packages or groupings based on a primary focus of processing responsi-\nbility. Separation of responsibilities is the fundamental principle behind multi-\nlayer design. In multilayer design, there are user-interface classes, business logic \nclasses, and data access classes. Each layer has a particular focus or area of \nresponsibility. Classes that share the same focus or concern are grouped together \nin a layer.", "domains": ["Design Principles", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "390: Each layer has a particular focus or area of \nresponsibility. Classes that share the same focus or concern are grouped together \nin a layer. This design principle allows flexibility in system deployment because \ndifferent layers, i.e., a grouping of classes, can be located on different computers \nor at different locations. \u25a0\n\u25a0Protection from Variations\nAnother underlying principle of good design is protection from variations\u2014\nthe principle that the parts of a system that are unlikely to change should be seg-\nregated (or protected) from those that will change. As you design systems, you \nshould try to isolate the parts that will change from those that are more stable. Protection from variations is a principle that affects the multilayer design \npattern. Designers could mix all the user-interface logic and business logic \ntogether in the same classes. In fact, in early user-oriented, event-driven sys-\ntems, such as those built with early versions of Visual Basic and PowerBuilder, \nthe business logic was included in the view layer classes\u2014often in the Windows \ninput forms. Many Web applications also combine HTML and business logic. The problem with this design was that when an interface needed to be updated, \nall the business logic had to be rewritten. A better approach is to decouple \nthe user-interface logic from the business logic. Then, the user interface can \nbe rewritten without affecting the business logic. In other words, the business \nlogic\u2014being more stable\u2014is protected from variations in the user interface. Also, what if updates to the business logic require the addition of new \nclasses and new methods? For example, if the user interface is included as part \nof the business classes, then changing the business logic would impact the user \nseparation of responsibilities\u2003 a design \nprinciple that recommends segregating \nclasses into separate packages or group-\nings based on a primary focus of processing \nresponsibility\nprotection from variations\u2003 a design \nprinciple in which parts of a system that are \nunlikely to change are segregated from those \nthat will\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

However, building the system with a use case controller allows the \nuser interface to simply send all its input messages to the use case controller \nclass. Thus, changes to the methods or classes in the business logic and domain \nlayer are isolated to the controller class. You will find that protection from vari-\nations affects almost every design decision, so you should watch for and recog-\nnize the application of this principle in all design activities. \u25a0\n\u25a0Indirection\nIndirection is the principle of separating two classes or other system compo-\nnents by placing an intermediate class between them to serve as a link. In other \nwords, instructions don\u2019t go directly from A to B; they are sent through C first. Or in message terminology, don\u2019t send a message from A to B. Let A send the \nmessage to C and then let C forward it to B. Although there are many ways to implement protection from variations, \nindirection is frequently used for that purpose. Inserting an intermediate object \nallows any variation in one system to be isolated in that intermediate object. Indirection is also useful for many corporate security systems. For example, \nmany companies have firewalls and proxy servers that receive and send mes-\nsages between an internal network and the Internet. A proxy server appears as a \nreal server\u2014ready to receive such messages as e-mail and HTML page requests. However, it is a fake server, which catches all the messages and redistributes \nthem to the recipients. This indirection step allows security controls to be put in \nplace and protect the system. A common example of indirection that we have been using throughout is the \ninsertion of a use case controller. The controller is a separate class that receives \nall the inputs and directs it to the appropriate domain classes. \u25a0\n\u25a0Coupling\nThis principle, coupling, and the next principle, cohesion, were originally \ndefined during the early days of software design and programming. However, \nboth principles continue to be extremely important and applicable to object-\noriented design. In the previous examples throughout the text of the RMO class diagram, \nyou have seen that the Customer class and the Sale class are linked together in \nan association relationship. Another term for this linking is coupled. Coupling \nis a qualitative measure of how closely the classes in a design class diagram are \nlinked.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Software Quality Attributes", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "391: Another term for this linking is coupled. Coupling \nis a qualitative measure of how closely the classes in a design class diagram are \nlinked. A simple way to think about coupling is by the number of association \nrelationships and whole/part relationships on the design class diagram. Previ-\nously, you learned about navigation visibility, which measures what a class can \nlink to and access. Low coupling is usually better for a system than high cou-\npling. For example, a Customer object can access a Sale object that belongs to \nit. However, if it can also directly access the SaleItem, that would be too much \ncoupling. Only the Sale object should be able to access its own SaleItem objects. We say that coupling is a qualitative measure because no specific number \nmeasures coupling in a system. It is a global measure that applies to a set of \nclasses for a particular use case design. It does not measure an individual class. A designer must develop a feel for coupling\u2014that is, recognize when there is too \nmuch or too little. Coupling is evaluated as a design progresses\u2014use case by use \ncase. Generally, if each use case design has a reasonable level of coupling, the \nentire system will too. Refer back to Figure 12-1 to observe the flow of messages between the \nobjects. Obviously, objects that send messages to each other must have visibility \nand thus are coupled. For the Input window object to send a message to the Stu-\ndent object, it must have visibility, or be coupled, to it.

{"text": "392: PART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nIf\u00a0we designed the system so the Input window object accessed the Database \naccess object, the overall coupling for this use case would increase; that is, there \nwould be more connections. Is that good or bad? In this simple example, it \nmight not be a problem. But for a system with 10 or more classes, too many \nconnections with visibility can cause high levels of coupling, making the system \nmore complex and therefore harder to maintain. So, why is high coupling bad? The main reason is that a change in one class \nripples through the entire system and may cause methods to fail. Therefore, \nexperienced analysts make every effort to simplify coupling and reduce ripple \neffects in the design of a new system. \u25a0\n\u25a0Cohesion\nCohesion refers to the consistency of the functions within a single class and is a \nqualitative measure of its focus or unity of purpose. Unlike coupling (where you \nwant low coupling), classes need to be highly cohesive to be well designed. For \nexample, in Figure 12-1, you would expect the Student class to have methods\u2014\nthat is, functions\u2014to enter student information, such as identification number \nor name. That would represent a unity of purpose and a highly cohesive class. But what if that same object also had methods to make classroom assignments \nor assign professors to courses? The cohesiveness of the class would be reduced. Classes with low cohesion have several negative effects. First, they are hard \nto maintain. Because they perform many different functions, they tend to be \noverly sensitive to changes within the system, suffering from ripple effects. \u00ad\nSecond, it is hard to reuse such classes because they have many different\u2014and \noften unrelated\u2014functions. For example, a button class that processes button \nclicks can easily be reused. However, a button class that processes both button \nclicks and user log-ins has limited reusability. A final drawback is that classes \nwith low cohesion are usually difficult to understand. Frequently, their func-\ntions are intertwined and their logic is complex.

This chapter focuses on the foundation principles, which are based \non the concepts of use case realization by using UML interaction diagrams \nand design patterns. You will learn how to use communication diagrams and \nsequence diagrams to extend the input messages and define internal messages. These techniques will first focus on the problem domain classes and then extend \nto multilayer design. The last section of this chapter is a brief introduction to design patterns. As with any engineering discipline, certain procedures have become tried and \nproven solutions. Even though object-oriented development is a relatively young \nengineering discipline, it offers standard ways to design use cases that lead to \nsolid, well-constructed solutions.

This chapter begins the discussion with communication dia-\ngrams and then moves to sequence diagrams. First, the following section briefly \ndiscusses the concept of a use case controller. \u25a0\n\u25a0The Use Case Controller\nThe previous chapter briefly introduced the concept of a use case controller in \nthe discussion of CRC cards, but did not elaborate on its use. In reality, a con-\ntroller class is part of a popular design technique called Model-View-Controller. (This technique is discussed in more detail in the \u201cUse Case Controller\u201d section \nunder \u201cDesign Patterns.\u201d)\nLet us formalize the concept of a use case controller. For any particular use \ncase, messages come from the external actor to a windows class\u2014that is, an \nelectronic input form\u2014and then to a problem domain class. One issue in sys-\ntems design is the question of which problem domain class should receive input \nmessages to reduce coupling, maintain highly cohesive domain classes, and pro-\ntect from variations between the user interface and the domain layer. (Do you \nremember these good design principles discussed in Chapter 12?) Designers often \ndefine intermediary classes that act as buffers between the user interface and the \ndomain classes. These classes are called use case controllers. For example, the \nuse case Fill shopping cart might have a controller class named CartHandler. A use case controller acts as a switchboard, taking input messages and rout-\ning them to the correct domain class. In effect, the use case controller acts as an \nintermediary between the outside world and the internal system. What if a par-\nticular window object needs to send messages to several problem domain objects? Without the use case controller, the input window would need references to all \nthese domain objects. The coupling between the input window object and the \ninternal system would be very high; there would be many connections. The cou-\npling between the user-interface objects and the problem domain objects could \nbe reduced by making a single use case controller object to handle all the input \nmessages. In this way, domain layer design classes can remain more cohesive by \nfocusing only on the precise functions that truly belong to that domain object. The following examples define a controller class for each use case.", "domains": ["Architectural Patterns and Styles", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

The \nselection of which classes to include is purely an estimate at this point because \nwe will not determine all the classes until we proceed with the design steps. However, in this simple example, the preliminary assessment is accurate. Do not \nworry if you do happen to omit some required classes. It will become evident \nduring the design process if something is missing. The other source of input information comes from the analysis \u00ad\nmodels. Chapter 5 developed several models for this use case, including a use case \ndescription (Figure 5-2), an activity diagram (Figure 5-4), and a system \nsequence diagram (Figure 5-10). Before initiating the design, you will want \nto look at all three models to understand as much as possible about the use \ncase. For this example, focus on the system sequence diagram, which is dupli-\ncated here as \u00ad\nFigure 13-5. There are three input messages and two return \nresponses. \u275a\n\u275aExtend Input Messages\nFor each input message, extend the message to the internal objects within the \n:System object. Follow this process:\n1. From the first-cut design class diagram, identify the classes that will be \n\u00ad\nrequired to carry out the execution of the message. Place the corresponding \nobjects on the diagram. 2. Beginning with the input message, identify each message that will be \nrequired for each of the included objects on the diagram.

{"text": "417: CHAPTER 13 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Use Case Realization\n\u275a\n\u275aAssumptions\nThe development of the first-cut sequence diagram is based on several assump-\ntions, including:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPerfect technology assumption. You first encountered this assumption in \nChapter 5, when identifying business events. The assumption continues \nhere. You don\u2019t include messages such as the user having to log on. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nPerfect memory assumption. You might have noticed our assumption that \nthe necessary objects were in memory and available for the use case. We \ndidn\u2019t ask whether those objects were created in memory. We will change \nthis assumption when we get to multilayer design. In multiple-layer design, \nwe do include the steps necessary to create objects in memory. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nPerfect solution assumption. The first-cut sequence diagram assumes that \nthere are no exception conditions. No logic is included to handle a situation \nin which the requested catalog or product isn\u2019t found. More serious excep-\ntion conditions, such as the failure of a credit check, might also be encoun-\ntered. Many developers design the basic processing steps first and then add \nthe other messages and processes to handle the exception conditions later. We do the same here. \u25a0\n\u25a0Developing a Multilayer Design\nSo far in the development of the sequence diagram, we have focused only on the \nclasses in the problem domain layer. In many instances, this may be sufficient \ndocumentation to program the solution\u2014either by yourself or with another pro-\ngrammer. Once you have a solid design for the problem domain classes, adding \nthe view layer and the data access layer is a straightforward, if time-consuming, \nprocess. Conforming to the principles of Agile modeling, we don\u2019t want to cre-\nate diagrams unless there is real benefit. We also don\u2019t normally keep the design \n\u00ad\ndiagrams as documentation because over time, the system will be modified and \nthe diagrams will become obsolete. As Agile modeling suggests, be prudent in the \n \ndevelopment of models. However, there are times when it is important to see the \ntotal picture and identify the need and use of the view layer classes and the\u00a0data \naccess layer classes. A system developer needs to know how to do \u00ad\ncomplete \ndesign for those instances when it is necessary. Every system will need view layer classes to represent the input and out-\nput screens for the application. Data access layer classes aren\u2019t always required.", "domains": ["Design Principles"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W. Satzinger, Robert B.

{"text": "417: Every system will need view layer classes to represent the input and out-\nput screens for the application. Data access layer classes aren\u2019t always required. The data access layer is required when the business logic is fairly complex and \nshould be isolated from the SQL statements that access the database. The CRC \ncards example in Chapter 12 for the Create customer account use case showed \nan example of a three-layer design with both view and data access classes (see \n\u00ad\nFigure 12-21). Because CRC cards is an informal technique, we simply added \nthe classes without much discussion of how they are to be connected to the \nproblem domain classes. The following sections develop that same example but \nwith a sequence diagram. This more rigorous modeling technique highlights the \nissues involved with three-layer design. First, we add the view layer, then the \ndata access layer. \u25a0\n\u25a0Designing the View Layer\nIn Chapter 8, you learned how to do the design of the user interface. In \u00ad\nreality, \nuser-interface design is both an analysis and a design activity. Quite a bit of \ndiscovery and understanding is being developed as the systems analysts and \nthe\u00a0users work together. However, design work is also being done because the \nactual detailed layout, including input and output data fields, is being devel-\noped.

{"text": "418: PART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nOne advantage of adding it to the sequence diagram is that the programmer can \nsee how the view layer classes integrate with the rest of the design. It becomes \na check to make sure the design is correct and complete. It is a good practice to \nverify several use cases to ensure that the developers understand how the view \nlayer represents the user-interface design and how all the elements integrate \ntogether for a smooth program execution. Thus, input for view layer design \nincludes the use case description, the SSD, the activity diagrams, the first-cut \ndesign class diagram, and, finally, the user-interface layouts or mock-ups. User-interface design and the integration of the view layer into a sequence \ndiagram are made even more complex by the fact that many systems require \nboth a Web-based interface and an internal, network-based interface. Fortu-\nnately, browsers are becoming more sophisticated, so many new systems can \nnow be designed for only one type of interface. Designing a system with multiple \nuser interfaces is a complex endeavor. Let\u2019s return to the Add customer account use case and add the view layer. Remember from the discussion of communication diagrams that there are three \ninput messages: createNewCustomer, enterAddress, and enterAccount. Let\u2019s \nassume that, from the results of our user-interface design, a separate input form \nfor each message is required. Let\u2019s add those classes to the sequence diagram. The starting point is Figure 13-11, which is the sequence diagram with the prob-\nlem domain classes. The process to add the view layer is simply to add an object \nfor each input form or screen. First add the appropriate messages from the Clerk \nto the input \u00abview\u00bb objects. In this instance, the messages are the ones identified \nfrom the SSD, and which were used in Figure 13-11. Additional messages are \nadded for the :CustWindow to open the :AddrWindow, and the :AddrWindow \nto open the :AcctWindow. Figure 13-18 illustrates the resulting diagram with \nboth the domain and view layers. In Figure 13-18, we just added a single view object for each message. This \napproach was rather straightforward. If we look at the other use case we have \nbeen using, Fill shopping cart, we have a more complex example. Remember \nthat the Fill shopping cart use case included other use cases for Search for item \nand View accessory combinations.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

{"text": "418: If we look at the other use case we have \nbeen using, Fill shopping cart, we have a more complex example. Remember \nthat the Fill shopping cart use case included other use cases for Search for item \nand View accessory combinations. Obviously, all those use cases go together \nfor a rich and efficient user experience. In Figure 13-19, we have added the \ntwo view layer objects for searching items and viewing accessories. The first \ninput message, addItem ( ), will go through the :SearchItemWindow object. In other words, when the customer finds something he or she likes, he or she \nwill initiate adding it to his or her cart from that window. The message then \ncauses a detailed :AddItemWindow object to display and show the details to \nverify the addition to the cart. This later window will forward the message on \nto :CartHandler. Once the item has been added to the cart, another window displays that \nshows the results of adding this new item. Depending on the design of the user \ninterface, this window might show the single newly added item or it might also \nshow the total shopping cart. The next three view layer objects, :ViewAccessWindow, :AddAccess\u00ad\nWindow, and :DisplayItem+AccessWindow, function in a manner similar to the \nother view layer objects. The only difference is that the data includes the item \nand the accessories that have been added to the online cart. Adding the view layer to your design is a good way to verify that the user \ninterface that was developed with the users is consistent with the application \ndesign. All the input messages that were identified and documented on SSDs \nmust be handled by the user interface. If there are messages without input win-\ndows or windows without messages, you will know that part of the design is \nincomplete and that more definition is required.

On large, complex systems, designers create \nthree-layer designs, including classes whose sole responsibility is executing data-\nbase SQL statements, getting the results of the query, and providing the informa-\ntion to the domain layer. As hardware and networks became more sophisticated, \nmultilayer design was used to support multitier networks in which the database \nserver was on one machine, the business logic was on another server, and the \nuser interface was on several desktop client machines. This way of designing \nsystems creates more robust and more flexible systems. In most cases, problem domain classes are also persistent classes, which \nmeans that their data values must be stored by the system even when the appli-\ncation isn\u2019t executing.

Dependency \nrelationships are used in package diagrams, class diagrams, and even interaction \ndiagrams. A good way to think about a dependency relationship is that if one \nelement changes (the independent element), the other (dependent) element might \nalso have to be changed. Dependency relationships can be between packages or \nbetween classes within packages. Figure 13-25 indicates that several classes in \nthe view layer are dependent on classes in the domain layer.

{"text": "427: CHAPTER 13 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Use Case Realization\nUnfortunately, these same tools have propagated some bad programming \nhabits in some developers. The ease with which programmers can build GUI \nwindows and automatically insert code has allowed them to put all the code in \nthe windows. Each window component has several associated events where code \ncan be inserted. Thus, some programmers find it easy to build a window with \nan IDE tool, let the tool automatically generate the class definition, and merely \ninsert business logic code. No new classes need to be defined, and little other \ncoding is required. Some of these tools also have database engines, so the entire \nsystem can be built with windows classes. However, taking such shortcuts exacts \na price later. The problem with this approach is the difficulty of maintaining the system. Code snippets scattered throughout the GUI classes are hard to find and main-\ntain. Plus, when the user-interface classes need to be upgraded, the program-\nmer must also find and update the business logic. If a network-based system \nneeds to be enhanced to include a Web front end, a programmer must rebuild \nnearly the entire system. Or if two user interfaces are desired, all the business \nlogic is programmed twice. Finally, without the tool that generates the code, it \nis almost impossible to keep the system current. This problem is exacerbated by \nnew releases of the IDE tools, which may not be compatible with earlier ver-\nsions. Many programmers have had to completely rewrite the front end of a \nsystem because the new release of an IDE tool didn\u2019t generate code the same way \nthe previous release did. Thus, we advise analysts and programmers to use good \ndesign principles in the development of new systems. Based on the design principle \u201cobject responsibility,\u201d it is possible to define \nwhich program responsibilities belong to each layer. If you follow these guide-\nlines when writing code, a system will be much easier to maintain throughout \nits lifetime. Let us summarize the primary responsibilities of each layer. View layer classes should have programming logic to perform the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDisplay electronic forms and reports. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nCapture such input events as clicks, rollovers, and key entries. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nDisplay data fields. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nAccept input data. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nEdit and validate input data. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nForward input data to the domain layer classes.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

The solution is general enough that it can be applied over and over \nagain. As time passes, the solution is documented and published, and eventually, \nit becomes accepted as the standard. Standard design templates have become popular among software developers \nbecause they can speed object-oriented design work. The formal name for these \ntemplates is design patterns. Design patterns became a widely accepted object-\noriented design technique in 1996 with the publication of Elements of Reusable \nObject-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, \nand John Vlissides. These four authors are now referred to as the Gang of Four \n(GoF). As you learn more about design patterns, you will often see references to \na particular design pattern as a GoF pattern. In their book, the authors identified \n23 basic design patterns. Today, scores of patterns have been defined\u2014from low-\nlevel programming patterns to midlevel architectural patterns to high-level enter-\nprise patterns. Two important enterprise platforms\u2014Java and .NET\u2014have sets \nof enterprise patterns, which are described in various books and publications. You are also familiar with the concepts of design patterns and with two \nspecific patterns: three-layer design and use case controllers. Patterns exist at \nvarious levels of abstraction. At a concrete level, a pattern may be a class defini-\ntion that is written in code to be used by any developer. At the most abstract \nlevel, a pattern might only be an approach to solving a problem. For example, \nthe multilayer design pattern tends to be more abstract. Thus, multilayer design \nis an approach to building a system rather than a specific solution. \u25a0\n\u25a0Use Case Controller\nIn Chapter 12, you were introduced to a design pattern called the Model-View-\nController pattern. Let us formalize the concept of a use case controller and \nexplain its importance as a design pattern. For any particular use case, messages \ncome from the external actor to a windows class (i.e., an electronic input form) \nand then to a problem domain class. This pattern answers the question of which \nproblem domain class should receive input messages to reduce coupling, main-\ntain highly cohesive domain classes, and maintain independence between the \nuser interface and the domain layer.

{"text": "430: PART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nThe adapter design pattern works just like the electrical adapter; it plugs \nan external component into an existing system. The method signatures on the \nexternal class are different from the method names being called from within the \nsystem, so the adapter class is inserted to convert the method calls from within \nthe system to the method names in the external class. Figure 13-28 describes the details of the adapter design pattern. The sample \ndiagram has four UML classes. The one labeled System represents the entire \nsystem. The classes within the system use such method names as getSTax() and \ngetUTax() to access the tax routines. The TaxCalculator class has the method \nnames findTax1() and findTax2(). The two UML classes in the middle represent \nthe adapter. The top middle class symbol represents an interface class. An inter-\nface is useful to specify the method names; although not absolutely necessary, it \nis a simple way to specify and enforce the use of the correct method names. The \nadapter class then inherits those method names and provides the method logic \nfor those methods. The body of each method simply extends a call to the final \nmethod name findTax1() or findTax2(). In other words, it \u201cadapts,\u201d or trans-\nlates, the method names from one to the other. As you become familiar with this design pattern, you will find that it has a \nmultitude of uses. It is a powerful and elegant solution to making a system more \nmaintainable. Experienced developers use this pattern frequently\u2014for foreign \nclasses and for internally written classes that may need frequent upgrades. It is \nan excellent way to insulate the system from frequently changing classes. \u25a0\n\u25a0Factory\nIn the discussions of detailed design, we have often expressed the need to have \nutility classes, which include the data access objects or controller classes. An \nadapter in an adapter pattern situation is also a utility class. What class should \ncreate these utility objects? In most situations, it doesn\u2019t make sense for domain \nclasses to create them because it isn\u2019t a listed responsibility of domain classes. A\u00a0popular solution in object-oriented programming is to have some classes that \nare factories. In other words, these classes instantiate objects from utility classes.

{"text": "433: CHAPTER 13 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Use Case Realization\nNotice that the singleton pattern has the same basic logic as the factory \nmethod pattern. The difference is that the singleton class has code that applies to \nitself as static methods. The approach of the singleton solution is that the class has \na static variable that refers to the created object. A method such as getConnection \nis defined and used to get the reference to the object. The first time the getCon-\nnection method is called, it instantiates an object and returns a reference to it. On \nlater calls to the method, it simply returns a reference to the already instantiated \nobject. The code is simple and elegant. The example doesn\u2019t show the constructor; \nhowever, to ensure that only one instance is created, all constructors are specified \nas private\u2014not accessible\u2014so no other class can accidentally invoke one. In the singleton template, the pattern is represented by code. To specify this \nin your design, you should stereotype the class as a \u00absingleton\u00bb. Good program-\nmers will recognize the stereotype and know exactly how to code the class. Singleton\nOnly one instantiation of a class is allowed. The instantiation (new) can be \ncalled from several places in the system. The first reference should make a\nnew instance, and later attempts should return a reference to the already\ninstantiated object. How do you define a class so that only one instance is \never created? A singleton class has a static variable that refers to the one instance of itself. All constructors to the class are private and are accessed through a method\nor methods, such as getInstance(). The getInstance() method checks the variable;\nif it is null, the constructor is called. If it is not null, then only the reference to\nthe object is returned.

This \ninformation is used to update the design class diagram. Changes are also made to the design class diagram to \nshow required visibility between the classes in order to \nsend messages in the sequence diagrams. Package dia-\ngrams are used to partition the design class diagram into \nappropriate packages. Dependency between the classes \nand the packages is also added to the package diagram. Popular design patterns include the adapter pat-\ntern, factory pattern, singleton pattern, and observer \npattern. The adapter pattern implements the design \nprinciple \u201cprotection from variations\u201d by allowing a \nchanging piece of the system to simply plug into a more \nstable part of the system. When the pluggable piece of \nthe system needs to change, it can just be unplugged \nand the updated component can be plugged in. The factory and singleton patterns have much in \ncommon. Both return a reference to a specific object. Both allow only one instance of that object to exist in \nthe system. The difference is that the factory pattern \nenforces a single occurrence for utility classes and the \nsingleton only enforces a single occurrence for itself. Detailed design is use case\u2013driven in that each use case \nis designed separately. This type of design is called use \ncase realization. The two primary models used for \ndetailed design are the design class diagram and the \nsequence diagram. Detailed design of use cases entails identifying \nproblem domain classes that collaborate to carry out \na use case. Each input message from an external actor \ntriggers a set of internal messages. Using a sequence \ndiagram or a communication diagram, the designer \nidentifies and defines all these internal messages. In \nthe first cut, only the problem domain classes and \ntheir internal messages are identified.

For example, consider \nthe complexity of manufacturing automobiles. Tens of thousands of parts \nmust be fabricated or purchased. Laborers and machines must assemble those \nparts into small subcomponents, such as dashboard instruments, wiring har-\nnesses, and brake assemblies. These are in turn assembled into larger subcom-\nponents, such as instrument clusters, engines, and transmissions, which in \nturn must be constructed, tested, and passed on to subsequent assembly steps. Opening case\u2002 Tri-State Heating Oil: Juggling Priorities to Begin Operation\nIt was 8:30 on Monday morning, and Maria Grasso, \nKim Song, Dave Williams, and Rajiv Gupta were about \nto begin the weekly project status meeting. Tri-State \nHeating Oil had started developing a new schedul-\ning system for customer orders and service calls five \nmonths earlier. The target completion date was 10 \nweeks away, but the project was behind schedule. Early project iterations had accomplished far less than \nanticipated because key users had disagreed on what \nnew system requirements to include and the system \nscope was larger than expected.

Testing is \nthe process of examining a component, subsystem, or system to determine its \noperational characteristics and whether it contains any defects. To conduct a \ntest, developers must have well-defined specifications for both functional and \nnonfunctional requirements. From the requirements specifications, test devel-\nopers develop precise definitions of expected operational characteristics. The \ndevelopers can test software by designing and building the software, \u00ad\nexercising \nits function, and examining the results.

Test types, their related core processes, and the defects they detect and oper-\national characteristics they measure are summarized in Figure 14-2. Each type \nof testing is described in detail later in this section. An important part of developing tests is specifying test cases and data.

Fortunately, automated tools based on proven mathematical tech-\nniques are available to generate a complete set of test cases. Many test cases \nrepresenting normal and exceptional processing situations should be prepared \nfor each scenario. \u25a0\n\u25a0Unit Testing\nUnit testing is the lowest level of and the earliest testing for a new software \n\u00ad\nsystem. The concept and approach to unit testing is not consistent across all \ndevelopment teams and, in fact, it has changed over the years as program-\nming methods and languages have changed. In today\u2019s object-oriented devel-\nopment approaches, a unit can be defined to be something as small as an \nindividual method. \u00ad\nHowever, a frequent definition is to define a unit as a \nclass or sometimes even a small set of closely integrated classes such as a \ncomponent. For our purposes, we define unit\u00a0test as a test of an individual \nmethod, class, or component before it is integrated with other software. The \nprimary purpose of doing unit testing is to test a small piece of the code in \nisolation to make sure that it functions correctly before it is integrated into a \nlarger program. Stated another way, its purpose is to make sure that the unit \nis error-free before being integrated into the larger program. There are three \nprimary characteristics of a unit test:\n1. It is done in isolation. 2. The test data and the test are done by the programmer who wrote  \nthe code. 3. It is done quickly without a large requirement for other resources. The first requirement is that the unit test be done in isolation.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W. Satzinger, Robert B.

{"text": "447: It is done quickly without a large requirement for other resources. The first requirement is that the unit test be done in isolation. The objec-\ntive of a unit test is to test a specific piece of software, and to be able to easily \nidentify the misbehaving code when an error occurs. If the unit is too large, or \nif it is not isolated, the error could come from some code or an interface other \nthan the specific code being tested. One of the difficulties of being able to iso-\nlate the unit being tested is that it often will depend on other software, either to \nreceive a parameter or to output a result. Figure 14-3 illustrates this condition. Suppose the piece of software is the colored box and the drawing on the left \ndescribes the location of the unit within a larger component. As can be seen, \nthe unit to be tested is called from and receives input parameters from another \ncomponent, and it passes output to two other components. A true unit test \nwould need to be configured as shown in the drawing on the right. A driver \nand a stub may need to be written and used to test the unit. In this example, \nthe stubs are overlapped to indicate that a single stub class could be used to \nreceive all unit test results. The second requirement is that pieces of code are tested by the program-\nmer who writes the code. This is the fastest and easiest approach to unit test-\ning.

It \nis just human nature that if you are not accountable for your work, the qual-\nity degrades substantially. On highly productive development teams, program-\nmers are well trained on how to conduct unit tests. For example, one caveat is \nthat both good test data and bad test data should be used in the unit test. The \nnatural tendency is to just use good test data and observe the expected result. However, a well-trained programmer also thinks of multiple ways that bad data \nmight be received, either from user input or other errors. Finally, unit testing should not require elaborate test cases or complex tex-\nting configurations. Depending on the environment and the language being \nused, there are also unit test generators that can be used. The test driver and test \nstub, as shown in the previous figure, can often be written as general purpose \nand can be used to test many different pieces of code. One of the characteris-\ntics of a good unit test is that it can be done quickly and frequently without \nsetting up an entire testing environment. Unit testing should enhance the pro-\ngrammer\u2019s productivity, not consume a lot of resources\u2014neither programmer \ntime nor computing resources.

After small units \nare tested, they are combined into a larger component and tested together. The objective of integration testing is both to test the interfaces between these \nunits and to test the entire integrated piece of software. An integration test \nevaluates the functional behavior of a group of classes or components when \nthey are combined together. Figure 14-4 illustrates this concept\u2014a new class \nor component is integrated into the existing, growing, and tested portion of \nthe system. The purpose of an integration test is to identify errors that weren\u2019t or \ncouldn\u2019t be detected by unit testing. There are two types of results that can \nbe tested.

Again, both \ngood data and bad data should be used for the test. Good input data should produce \nthe correct expected result. Bad data should be captured and handled appropriately. Integration testing often begins small, with an individual programmer com-\nbining the classes that she has developed into a larger component and tested. However, it soon grows to required components developed by different pro-\ngrammers to be combined and tested together. Consequently, the complexity of \nintegration testing increases rapidly.

Normally, the programmer who wrote \nthe original code makes the corrections, conducts any required unit tests, \nand submits the components back for integration testing. The person con-\nducting the integration test usually attempts to identify and isolate the \ncause of the error as much as possible. Integration testing of object-oriented software is quite complex. Because an \nobject-oriented program consists of a set of interacting objects that can be cre-\nated or destroyed during execution, there is often no clear hierarchical structure. As a result, object interactions and control flow are dynamic and complex. Additional factors that complicate object-oriented integration testing include \nthe following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMethods can be (and usually are) called by many other methods, and the \ncalling methods may be distributed across many classes. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nClasses may inherit methods and state variables from other classes. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nThe specific method to be called is dynamically determined at run time \nbased on the number and type of message parameters. \u25a0\n\u25a0\nObjects can retain internal variable values (i.e., the object state) between \ncalls.

System testing often is used to verify the \nnonfunctional requirements, such as response time and throughput. The line \nseparating integration testing from system testing is fuzzy, as is the line between \nimplementation and deployment activities. The important differences are scope \nand timing. Integration tests are performed more frequently and on smaller com-\nponent groups. System tests are performed less frequently on entire systems or \nsubsystems. In addition, there are various kinds of system tests that test various \nfunctional and nonfunctional aspects of the new system.

{"text": "451: CHAPTER 14 \u25a0 Deploying the New System\nsystem testing activities are often performed at the end of each iteration where \nsoftware is completed. Even with systems that are grown organically, there are \nusually natural plateaus where a subsystem is completed and delivered. System \ntests are performed on each of these subsystems as they become ready. System testing may also be performed more frequently. A build and smoke \ntest is a system test that is typically performed daily or several times per week. The system is completely compiled and linked (built), and a battery of tests is \nexecuted to see whether anything malfunctions in an obvious way (\u201csmokes\u201d). Build and smoke tests are valuable because they provide rapid feedback on \nsignificant integration problems. Any problem that occurs during a build and \nsmoke test must result from software modified or added since the previous test. Daily testing ensures that errors are found quickly and that they can be easily \ntracked to their sources. Less-frequent testing provides rapidly diminishing ben-\nefits because more software has changed and errors are more difficult to track \nto their sources. A performance test, also called a stress test, determines whether a sys-\ntem or subsystem can meet such time-based performance criteria as response \ntime or throughput. Response time requirements specify desired or maxi-\nmum allowable time limits for software responses to queries and updates. \u00ad\nThroughput requirements specify the desired or minimum number of queries \nand transactions that must be processed per minute or hour. Performance tests are complex because they can involve multiple programs, \nsubsystems, computer systems, and network infrastructure. They require a large \nsuite of test data to simulate system operation under normal or maximum load. Diagnosing and correcting performance test failures are also complex. Bottle-\nnecks and underperforming components must first be identified.

{"text": "451: The UAT is normally the final stage in testing the system. Although the primary focus is usually on the functional requirements, the non-\nfunctional requirements are often also verified. In some cases, UAT is a formal milestone, and requires completion and sign-\noff by the client. Details of acceptance tests may even be included in a request for \nproposal (RFP) and procurement contract when a new system is built by or pur-\nchased from an external party. In those situations, payments to the developers \nare often tied to passing specific acceptance tests. In other situations, particu-\nlarly in Agile projects where the user is involved with the project team, UAT may \nbe less formal and may be integrated into the normal development activities. In either situation, whether UAT is a formalized process or an informal \ncomponent of the development, it is a critical component of the development \nproject.

There are \nmany resources and instruction books on how to plan and execute a successful \nUAT. You are invited to do further study into this topic. The following sections \nbriefly discuss three areas\u2014planning, preparation, and execution of the UAT. \u275a\n\u275aPlanning the Uat\nThe UAT should be included in the total project plan, and whether it will be \nincluded in specific iterations or have its own iterations toward the end of the \nproject. Detailed plans for the UAT itself need to be developed early. There are \nimportant decisions and preparations that must be done throughout the proj-\nect. Waiting until late in the project to plan the UAT causes serious difficulties \nand delays. In Chapters 2 and 3, you learned about business events, user stories, and \nuse cases. You also learned about functional and nonfunctional requirements. All of these items created requirements and specifications. The UAT should be \nprepared to test all of them. Test cases should be identified to test various busi-\nness events, including external events (from the users), temporal events (such as \nmonth-end and year-end processing and reporting), and state events (such as \ninventory order points triggered). You also learned about FURPS+ as a basis \nfor defining specifications. The test plan should address each of these areas and \ndefine appropriate test cases to verify the fulfillment of the specification. The important point here is that as user stories are identified, as use cases \nare defined, and as nonfunctional requirements are documented, UAT test \ncases can be identified that will enable the verification of the specifications. In \nother words, developing the details of what is to be included in the UAT occurs \nthroughout the project. The UAT test plan begins early and continues through-\nout the project. As each requirement is specified, the following question should \nbe asked: \u201cHow can the UAT test that this specification is complete?\u201d\nA frequent complaint by developers is that this is a lot of work. The answer is \ntwofold. A simple test identification list can be created and maintained through-\nout the project. Figure 14-7 illustrates a possible form.

It is more work to predefine the \nfields of data, but verification of expected results is easier. The planning and creation of test data necessitates more detailed planning \nof the UAT. For example in Figure 14-7, the third specification to ship items can \nbe done with data already existing in the database, or it can use data created by \nearlier specifications. Hence, the planning of the sequence of tests will assist in \nthe development of the test data. Another example of required planning is the \ntesting of month-end and year-end processing. In both of those cases, there will \nneed to be appropriate detail in the database in order for the test to be meaning-\nful. The question arises whether that data needs to be created from scratch, or \nif the previous tests will create sufficient data. It should be evident that the cre-\nation of test data can be a large endeavor. Another area of pre-UAT activity is to set up the test environment. Because one \nof the purposes of the UAT is to verify that the system will function in the day-to-\nday business environment, it is usually necessary to set up a separate test computer \nand environment that simulates the true business environment as much as possible. This will include computers, networks, databases, operating systems, and so forth. \u275a\n\u275aManagement and Execution of the Uat\nOne of the important decisions is who will participate and who has responsibil-\nity for the UAT. Because the objective of the UAT is user acceptance, the system \nusers have primary responsibility. Ideally, system users will take full responsibil-\nity for identifying test cases, creating test data, and carrying out the UAT. Unfor-\ntunately, in many organizations, the users either are not prepared, do not have \nenough expertise, or do not have time from their regular responsibilities to take \nover the testing completely. The user should always have the final say whether a \ntest is successful and a requirement satisfied. However, it is not uncommon that \nsome project personnel are required to help plan, organize, and execute the tests. Managing the UAT is like a mini-project in and of itself. As mentioned, both \nusers and development personnel are part of the team. Specific tests need to be \nscheduled.

{"text": "455: CHAPTER 14 \u25a0 Deploying the New System\n\u275a\n\u275aReloading Databases\nMore complex changes to database structure may require creating an entirely new \ndatabase and copying and converting data from the old database to the new data-\nbase. Whenever possible, utility programs supplied with the DBMS are used to \ncopy and convert the data. In more complex conversions, implementation staff \nmust develop programs to perform the conversion and transfer some or all of the \ndata. The upper portion of Figure 14-10 shows both approaches. In either case, the \nold database can be discarded once the conversion and transfer process is complete. The middle of Figure 14-10 shows a more complex approach that uses an \nexport utility, an import utility, and a temporary data store. This approach \nmight be employed when the source and target databases employ different data-\nbase technologies; no utility exists that can directly translate from one to the \nother, but a \u201cneutral\u201d format exists that can serve as a bridge. Data from paper records can be entered by using the same programs being \n\u00ad\ndeveloped for the operational system. In that case, data-entry programs are usually \ndeveloped and tested as early as possible. Initial data entry can be structured as a user \ntraining exercise. For greater efficiency, data from paper records can also be scanned \ninto an optical character recognition program and then entered into the database by \nusing custom-developed conversion programs or a DBMS import utility. In some cases, it may be possible to begin system operation with a partially \nor completely empty database. For example, a customer order-entry system need \nnot have existing customer information loaded into the database. Customer \ninformation could be added the first time a customer places an order, based on \na dialogue between a telephone order-entry clerk and the customer.

The key issue to analyze is dependency\u2014that is, which classes \nand methods capture or generate data that are needed by other classes or meth-\nods? Dependency information is documented in package diagrams and may also \nbe documented in a class diagram. Thus, either or both diagram types can guide \nimplementation order decisions. For example, the package diagram in Figure 14-15 shows that the Cus-\ntomer Account and Marketing subsystems don\u2019t depend on any of the other sub-\nsystems. The Sales subsystem depends on the Customer Account and Marketing \nsubsystems, and the Order Fulfillment and Reporting subsystems depend on the \nSales subsystem. The chief advantage of the IPO development order is that it simplifies test-\ning. Because input programs and modules are developed first, they can be used \nto enter test data for process and output programs and modules. IPO develop-\nment order is also advantageous because important user interfaces (e.g., data-\nentry routines) are developed early. User interfaces are more likely to require \nchange during development than during other portions of the system, so early \ndevelopment allows for early testing and user evaluation. If changes are needed, \nthere is still plenty of time to make them. Early development of user interfaces \nalso provides a head start for related activities, such as training users and writ-\ning documentation.

{"text": "462: PART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\n\u275a\n\u275aTop-Down and Bottom-Up Development Order\nThe terms top-down and bottom-up have their roots in traditional structured \ndesign and structured programming. A traditional structured design decom-\nposes software into a series of modules or functions, which are hierarchically \nrelated to one another. As a visual analogy, consider a typical organization chart \nwith the president or CEO at the top. In structured design, a single module (the \npresident or CEO) controls the entire software program. Modules at the bottom \nperform low-level specialized tasks when directed to do so by a module at the \nnext higher level. Top-down development begins with the CEO and works \ndownward. Bottom-up development begins with the detailed modules at the \nlowest level and works upward to the CEO. Top-down and bottom-up program development can also be applied to \nobject-oriented designs and programs, although a visual analogy isn\u2019t obvious \nwith object-oriented diagrams. The key issue is method dependency\u2014that is, \nwhich methods call which other methods. Within an object-oriented subsystem \nor class, method dependency can be examined in terms of navigation visibility, \nas discussed in Chapters 12 and 13. The primary advantage of top-down development is that there is always a \nworking version of a program. As each method or class is implemented, stubs \nfor the methods or classes on the next lower level are added. At every stage of \ndevelopment, the program can be executed and tested, and its behavior becomes \nmore complex and realistic as development proceeds. \u275a\n\u275aUse-Case Driven\nIPO, top-down, and bottom-up development are only starting points for creat-\ning implementation and iteration plans. Other factors that must be considered \ninclude use-case-driven development, user feedback, training, documentation, \nand testing. Use cases deserve special attention in determining development \norder because they are one of the primary bases for dividing a development proj-\nect into iterations. In most projects, developers choose a set of related use cases for a single \niteration and complete analysis, design, implementation, and deployment activi-\nties. Use-case-driven development occurs when developers choose which \nuse cases to focus on first based on such factors as minimizing project risk, \nefficiently using nontechnical staff, or deploying some parts of the system ear-\nlier than others. For example, use cases with uncertain requirements or high \ntechnical risks are typically addressed in early iterations.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.

Addressing uncertain \nrequirements requires usability and other testing by nontechnical development \nstaff, and those staff members may only be available at certain times in the \nproject.

{"text": "463: CHAPTER 14 \u25a0 Deploying the New System\nA programmer checks out a file in read-only mode when he or she wants to \nexamine the code without making changes (e.g., to examine a module\u2019s inter-\nfaces to other modules). When a programmer needs to make changes to a file, \nhe or she checks out the file in read/write mode. The SCCS allows only one pro-\ngrammer to check out a file in read/write mode. The file must be checked back \nin before another programmer can check it out in read/write mode. Figure 14-16 shows the source code control display of Microsoft Visual \nStudio. Various source code files from the RMO CSS are shown in the display. Some files are currently checked out by programmers. For each file checked out \nin read/write mode, the program lists the programmer who checked it out, the \ndate and time of checkout, and whether the copy currently stored in the central \nrepository is the most current (latest) version. An SCCS prevents multiple programmers from updating the same file at the \nsame time, thus preventing inconsistent changes to the source code. Source code \ncontrol is an absolute necessity when programs are developed by multiple pro-\ngrammers. It prevents inconsistent changes and automates coordination among \nprogrammers and teams. The repository also serves as a common facility for \nbackup and recovery operations. \u25a0\n\u25a0Packaging, Installing, and Deploying Components\nAs with the other disciplines discussed in this chapter, deployment activities are \nhighly interdependent with activities of the other disciplines. In short, a system \nor subsystem can\u2019t be deployed until it has been implemented and tested.

{"text": "473: CHAPTER 14 \u25a0 Deploying the New System\nThe two-phase deployment minimizes project risk by dividing a single large \ndeployment into two smaller deployments. Another key risk mitigation feature \nis maintaining the current CSS and its database as a backup for at least one \niteration after version 1.0 deployment. If a serious problem arises with version \n1.0, RMO can revert to the current CSS simply by redirecting Web site accesses \nback to its internal servers. \u25a0\n\u25a0Database Development and Data Conversion\nMany of the classes in the CSMS class diagram are already represented in the \nexisting CSS database. However, there are some new classes and associations \nand some changes to existing classes. Thus, there is some degree of compatibility \nbetween the old and new databases, but not enough to enable an upgraded ver-\nsion of the current database to directly interface with both systems. Thus, a new \nCSMS database will need to be built, and data will need to be migrated from the \nCSS database prior to deploying version 1.0. Database development and migration prior to version 1.0 deployment will \noccur over multiple iterations. The iteration plan calls for creating a copy of the \nCSS database early in the project and making incremental changes to it. All data \nin the production CSS database will be migrated to the CSMS database near the \nend of the fourth iteration. If problems are encountered, they will be resolved \nand the migration will be repeated as early as possible during the fifth iteration. Migrating much of the data during the fourth iteration will enable fifth-iteration \ntesting of user interfaces with real data from real customers and products and \nsystem and stress testing with a \u201cproduction sized\u201d database. At the end of the fifth iteration, all CSS database changes since the last \nfull migration will be copied to the CSMS database. Copying only the changes \nwill enable migration within a matter of hours. The CSS system will be offline \nduring the migration. Cutover to the CSMS will occur as soon as the migration \nis completed. To minimize risk, additional data conversion routines will copy \nnew data from the CSMS database back to the CSS database twice per day \nduring the fifth iteration.

HudsonBanc decided that \na new component-based, Web-oriented system should be \nbuilt or purchased. Management preferred the purchase \noption because it was assumed that a purchased system \ncould be brought online more quickly and cheaply. An RFP \n(request for proposal) was prepared, many responses were \nreceived, and after months of business modeling and re-\nquirements activities, a vendor was chosen. Hardware for the new system was installed in early \nJanuary. Software was installed the following week, \nand a random sample of 10 percent of the customer ac-\ncounts was copied to the new system. The new system \nwas \u00ad\noperated in parallel with the old systems for two \nmonths. To save costs involved with complete duplication, \nthe new system computed but didn\u2019t actually print billing \nstatements. Payments were entered into both systems \nand used to update parallel customer account databases. \u00ad\nDuplicate account records were checked manually to en-\nsure that they were the same. After the second test billing cycle, the new system \nwas declared ready for operation. All customer accounts \nwere migrated to the new system in mid-April. The old sys-\ntems were turned off on May 1, and the new system took \nover operation. Problems occurred almost immediately. The system was unable to handle the greatly increased \nvolume of transactions. Data entry and customer Web ac-\ncess slowed to a crawl, and payments were soon backed \nup by several weeks. The system wasn\u2019t handling certain \ntypes of transactions correctly (e.g., charge corrections and \ncredits for overpayment). Manual inspection of the recently \nmigrated account records showed errors in approximately \n50,000 accounts. It took almost six weeks to adjust the incorrect ac-\ncounts and update functions to handle all transaction types \ncorrectly. On June 20, the company attempted to print \nbilling statements for the 50,000 corrected customer ac-\ncounts. The system refused to print any information for \ntransactions more than 30 days old. A panicked consulta-\ntion with the vendor concluded that fixing the 30-day re-\nstriction would require more than a month of work and \ntesting. It was also concluded that manual entry of account \nadjustments followed by billing within 30 days was the fast-\nest and least risky way to solve the immediate problem.

Twenty-five \npeople were reassigned from other operational areas, and \nadditional phone lines were added to provide sufficient cus-\ntomer support capacity. System development personnel \nwere reassigned to IS operations for up to three months \nto assist in clearing the billing backlog. Federal and state \nregulatory authorities stepped in to investigate the prob-\nlems. HudsonBanc agreed to allow customers to spread \npayments for late bills over three months without interest \ncharges.

The database requirements and \ndesign for the old and new systems are very similar. Unfortunately, the existing system stores its data in a \nMicrosoft Access database, which provides little sup-\nport for simultaneous access and updates by multiple \nusers. An important reason for replacing the current \nsystem is to upgrade to a DBMS that can easily sup-\nport many simultaneous accesses. The current plan is to use Microsoft SQL Server \nas the new DBMS and to migrate all data from the \nexisting Microsoft Access database immediately prior \nto full deployment. Perform these tasks to prepare for \nthis migration:\n\t\n1. Investigate data migration from Microsoft Access \nto SQL Server. What tools are available to assist \nin or perform the migration? If there are multiple \npossible tools, which should you use and why? 2. Develop plans to test the migration tools/strat-\negy in advance of full deployment.

If not, \nexplain why not and describe how you would \ndevelop and deploy the system. On the Spot Courier Services\nIn Chapter 10, we identified these four subsystems:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCustomer Account subsystem (such as Customer \nAccount)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPickup Request subsystem (such as Sales)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPackage Delivery subsystem (such as Order \nFulfillment)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nRouting and Scheduling subsystem\nIn Chapter 10, you also decided on a development \norder for these four subsystems, assuming a single \ntwo-person team. In Chapter 11, you created indi-\nvidual subsystem iteration schedules and a combined \nproject schedule. In Chapter 7, you identified equip-\nment that would be needed for the system. Your assignment for this chapter is to develop a \ntest plan for each subsystem and for the overall proj-\nect as well as to develop a conversion/deployment \nschedule. 1. For your test plan, do the following:\n\t\n\t a. \u0007\nDevelop an iteration test plan (i.e., one that \napplies to and can be used within a subsystem \niteration mini-project). Discuss which types \nof testing (as identified in this chapter) you \nwould include and why. Estimate how much \ntime will be needed for each type of test. \u00ad\nDiscuss what types of testing might be com-\nbined or scheduled with an overlap. b. \u0007\nDevelop a total project test plan to integrate \nall the subsystems. Discuss which types of \ntesting you would include and why. (Don\u2019t \nput them on a schedule yet.) 2. \u0007\nDevelop a conversion/deployment plan. Discuss \nthese:\n\t\n\t a. \u0007\nData conversion: Which parts of the data \nmust be saved from the old spreadsheet/\nmanual system? Which parts of the data \ncan just be discarded (i.e., not moved to the \nnew system)? Discuss specific tables that you \n\u00ad\nidentified in Chapter 9.\n\t\n\t b. \u0007\nDeployment: Based on your decisions about \nwhich subsystems should be deployed first \n(Chapter 10), your overall testing plan, and \nyour data conversion decisions, develop an \noverall schedule for testing and deployment of \nthe new system.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "Systems Analysis and Design in - John W.
