{"text": "Foreword\nIt still happens, no matter how hard we try. In our agency, we get clients\nwho look at the proposal, see the line item marked \u201cDesign\u201d, and question\nwhy we can\u2019t just \u201cdesign it as we build\u201d. And there was a time we would\njust go ahead and do it. I used to consider myself a \u201cdesigner/developer,\u201d\nthe rare unicorn that could do both\u2014a solid eye for design and all the\nsensitivity of a real artist, combined with the technical prowess and\nengineering mindset of a real nerd. I was the perfect web guy.\nBrian Miller and his design team cured me of that. It was from them that I\nreally learned what design was about in the context of web technology. I\nlearned how much really goes into a quality website design. I learned that\nit\u2019s as much about what is NOT on the screen as what IS on the screen. I\nlearned that everything we were looking at on the first PSD was there for a\nreason\u2014everything had a purpose. And it wasn\u2019t just a purpose, it was a\ndefendable purpose. Every font-size, every margin-left, every padding-top,\nline-height, letter-spacing, height and width . . . each one was carefully\nconsidered and important.\nI first met Brian when my now-defunct firm was contracted to build the\nfront end for a website he was designing. Having now worked with Brian\nfor nearly a decade, for a time as his employee and now again as colleagues\nwith my own new and different agency, I find it hard to work with a lot of\ndesigners. It\u2019s not because they aren\u2019t talented, it\u2019s because very few put the\nkind of thoughtfulness and consideration into the WHY of their design.\n", "page": 12, "type": "text", "section": "Page 12"}
{"text": "That\u2019s what makes this book so valuable of a resource . . . it doesn\u2019t try to\nteach you how to be a talented designer. That\u2019s on you. This teaches the\nwhy, and intuitively links it to the how.\nAs a developer, it took quite some time for me to understand the true\npartnership design and development can have in a project. So often that\nrelationship is confrontational\u2014designers making things that developers\nhave to figure out how to make work, and constantly pushing and pulling\nbetween the two until you end up with a final product that is the result of\ncompromise, and it shows. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Design that\ntakes into account the elastic medium of the browser, as well as the\nunpredictable whims of the user, is not only a better end product, but also a\njoy to build.\nBy my count, I\u2019ve worked on close to 100 sites with Brian, each one made\nbetter by the principles found in this book.

{"text": "Introduction to Web Design\nThere\u2019s an old legend in the world of football that says\nVince Lombardi, head coach of the Green Bay Packers,\nstarted every season with a speech to his players about\nthe game of football. He began the lecture by holding up\na football and saying, \u201cGentlemen, this is a football.\u201d He\nproceeded to describe its size and shape, and talk about\nhow it could be thrown, kicked, and carried. Then he\u2019d\npoint down at the field and say, \u201cThis is a football field.\u201d\nHe\u2019d walk around, describing the dimensions, the shape,\nthe rules, and how the game was played.\nThis Is the Internet\n", "page": 15, "type": "text", "section": "Page 15"}
{"text": "The message from the two-time Super Bowl-winning coach was simple: to\ntruly be effective at anything, one can never forget the basics. This simple\ndemonstration stripped away the complexities of the game and reduced it to\nits essence. In doing this, Lombardi refocused his team\u2019s attention on what\nwas truly important about succeeding at the game of football.\nTaking a cue from Vince Lombardi, I\u2019d like to conduct a similar exercise\nfor you: Turn on a web-enabled device (PC, laptop, tablet, mobile phone,\netc.), open the web browser of your choice (Safari, Chrome, Firefox,\nMicrosof Edge, etc.), type in the address of your favorite website, and\nbehold\u2014this is the internet. The internet is a series of interconnected\ncomputers, called servers, that enables companies, brands, organizations,\ngovernments, religious groups, and individuals to share information on a\nworldwide scale in real time. The World Wide Web or web, for short, is\nactually only a portion of the internet, which also includes all aspects of\ncomputer-to-computer communication like email, messaging, and file\nserving, just to name a few.\nWhen an internet user types the address of a website into his or her web\nbrowser, the device transmits a signal to a server, and the server responds\nby sending bits of information back to the computer. This information\nincludes images, raw content, and instructions for the computer to\nreassemble the layout, called markup (the M in HTML). The computer then\ntakes that information and configures the files based on two things: the\nmarkup and styles that came from the designer/developer, and the\npreferences and limitations of the web browser and device itself. When a\ndevice reassembles a web page that it has received from a server, the\nfollowing factors influence exactly how that page appears on the screen.\n", "page": 16, "type": "text", "section": "Page 16"}
{"text": "DEVICE\nThe type of device and version of the operating system (OS) the audience is\nusing to browse a site can have an effect on how a site is seen. The number\nof operating systems has increased over recent years. Instead of focusing on\nApple versus Microsoft, designers and developers now have mobile\nplatforms to contend with\u2014iOS (Apple), Windows Mobile, Android\n(Google), and to some extent Blackberry. A primary difference between\noperating systems is how typography is handled, including the fonts that are\navailable natively and how smoothly the fonts are rendered. Chapter 6 takes\nan in-depth look at typography.\nSCREEN RESOLUTION\n", "page": 17, "type": "text", "section": "Page 17"}
{"text": "Not to be confused with the screen size in inches, resolution is the\ndimension in pixels measured horizontally and vertically on a screen. Most\ndesktop monitors range from 800 pixels wide by 600 pixels high to 1024\npixels wide by 768 pixels high\u2014and high resolution, or Retina Displays,\ncan reach as much as 3072 \u00d7 1920. Tablets have similar resolutions, while\nmobile devices can be as little as 320 pixels wide. Because of this dilemma\nof differing screen resolutions, designers and developers created the idea of\nresponsive design. Discussed further in chapter 3, responsive design\ndisplays different layouts for a single web page in response to the screen\nresolution, making it possible to maximize legibility and usability\nregardless of the size of the screen on which the content is displayed.\nWEB BROWSER\nThe primary web browsers used today are Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and\nMicrosoft Edge, both desktop and mobile versions. A web browser is an\napplication whose function is to receive layout and styling information from\na host and display that information on screen. Because these are different\napplications developed by different companies, they all interpret this\ninformation slightly differently. Added to this, the language that makes up\nweb styling\u2014cascading style sheets, or CSS\u2014is always evolving;\ntherefore, web browsers are constantly updating to keep up with the latest\nstyling attributes.\n", "page": 18, "type": "text", "section": "Page 18"}
{"text": "CONNECTION SPEED\nThe connection speed is the speed with which a computer or device can\nconnect to the internet and download the assets required to build a page.\nThis has been an on-again, off-again issue through the years. The first\ncomputers to connect to the internet did so with modems that used phone\nlines, which were very slow, causing the need for \u201clightweight\u201d pages\u2014\npages created mostly of text and color, with few images. Then came DSL\nand cable modems, making high-speed internet possible, and web page\ndesign evolved to include large amounts of imagery. Enter the cell phone,\nand people began browsing the web with slower connection speeds, until\nWi-Fi and high-speed mobile connections evolved. While the connection\nspeed of a user browsing a site won\u2019t have a direct effect on how a site\nlooks, it will definitely have an effect on the person\u2019s experience of the site.\nLimiting subjective decisions and being\ncreative within those limitations is the essence\nof what all designers do.\nDesigning for the Web\n", "page": 19, "type": "text", "section": "Page 19"}
{"text": "To complicate matters, beyond these inherent system-based influences,\nindividual user preferences also can affect the way a site looks. In this\nimage we see the \u201cContent\u201d preferences in the Firefox web browser. These\ncontrols allow a savvy web user to change the fonts, the minimum size for\ntype (this is an accessibility feature for users with impaired vision), the\ncolors used for links, and even whether links are underlined. In some cases,\nthese user preferences can even override the design decisions a designer has\nmade for a page.\nIt is this aspect of disassembling a design and allowing the user to\nreassemble it under a varying set of circumstances that makes web design a\nunique and challenging form of design. These unique factors create added\nlimitation considerations, and new possibilities, for the designer. Dealing\nwith these factors and the potential issues they can cause in the clear\ncommunication of a message or a brand image requires a specific process.\nThe influence of the web browser on web design can be seen clearly in the\nfollowing timeline. As the browser evolved, so did the sophistication of the\ndesign treatments for web pages. Also evident on the following timeline is\nthe uniquely web idea of \u201cpublish, then polish.\u201d For many web-based\norganizations, like the ones in the timeline, getting something online is\nmore important than getting the perfect thing online.

{"text": "The first section of Principles of Web Design explores the steps that are\nrequired to plan out a website. Planning is not unique to web design, of\ncourse, but there are some unique considerations a web designer must be\naware of in order to avoid common pitfalls. Even the simplest of websites\ncan be defined as an application with a unique set of utilities that need to be\nmanipulated by the user. Identifying the requirements of this application,\nincluding the goals of the client, is a great first step for any web project.\nThe resulting requirements document can be referred to throughout the\nentire project to create success factors to be used to evaluate the project in\nthe end.\nAnother benefit of this planning stage is that it helps designers break up\nlarge tasks into manageable smaller tasks. Mapping out the relationships\nbetween large amounts of complex information or detailing the flow of a\nparticular user task are examples of things that should be addressed prior to\nbeginning the design phase in order to make sure they\u2019re getting the\nattention they require.\nIn addition to having a plan, web designers need to have a contingency plan\n\u2014a backup plan that allows for user variables.\nThe collection of these plans is called User Experience Design, or UX.\nDesigning the experience that\u2019s right for the target customer (in addition to\nwhat we traditionally think of as graphic design\u2014styling, typography, and\nimagery) is critical to being a successful web designer. It\u2019s the criteria by\nwhich each of the samples shown in this book has been judged. They go\nbeyond looking good: they look good, they work well, and in many cases\nthey add an element of delight to the experience. It\u2019s also the criteria that\nthe web-browsing population uses to determine how successful a website\nwill be.\n", "page": 28, "type": "text", "section": "Page 28"}

Twitter\u2019s popularity\nis largely due to two main things: It\u2019s a simple idea, telling your followers\nwhat you\u2019re up to; and it is executed simply, with an emphasis on user\ninteraction. It is a utility that lets users have enough control over the\nexperience to make them feel as if they\u2019re expressing themselves, but not so\nmuch control that the experience becomes overwhelming or intimidating.\nThis is all a direct result of excellent planning and user experience design\n\u2014 if perhaps not graphic design.\nDesign\nThe second section of Principles of Web Design looks at the specific\nattributes of web design and layout. To explore the subject of design for any\nmedium, it\u2019s important to define the term design. At its most basic, design is\na plan. Things that are said to have happened \u201cby design\u201d are said to have\nhappened not by accident.\nA finished design is simply the result of a series of decisions made by a\ndesigner to express a specific brand image and communicate a message.\nEach decision a designer makes leaves him or her open for subjective\n", "page": 29, "type": "text", "section": "Page 29"}

But it is paramount to the success of a site. Marketing is very\nsexy\u2014social, viral, guerrilla. It is these concepts of SEO and marketing that\nbring users to a site and ultimately lead to its business success.\nFinally, web design offers an unprecedented opportunity to analyze and\nadjust a design based on detailed, real-time information. Improvements to\nthe design or usability of a site can be done on the fly with no limits to the\nnumber of changes that can be made. Analytic software, such as Google\nAnalytics, provides countless pieces of data that help a designer understand\nthe habits of the users of a site.\nEach of the topics in Principles of Web Design, from planning and design to\nmarketing and analysis, can be researched in much greater depth than what\nis presented here. It is also equally important to take in the breadth of these\nprinciples. They are interconnected; too great a focus on one area over\nanother will result in a less than successful product.

The client\nshould reap long-term benefits, from a reduction in the development cost\nnormally associated with inflexible or flawed systems, to decreased training\ncosts. These benefits help clients make the most of their Website and\nachieve the highest return on their investment (ROI).\nPlans also help the design team define the parameters of a project for\nestimating purposes.

A creative brief outlines the goals for a project, the special\nconsiderations the team must take in order to complete the project\neffectively, as well as a schedule of milestone events.

{"text": "One of the most important aspects of design is the concept of hierarchy.\nVisual hierarchy is the sequencing of elements within a design so that a user\nmay perceive them in a specific and logical order. This sequence clearly\ndefines the most important elements of the design, followed by the second\nmost important elements, and so on. Almost every type of information can\nbe broken down into three or four levels of importance. More than that\nmakes contrasting the difference between the levels difficult.\nAn effective design system takes precedence\nover the individual elements, so that the user\nperceives a cohesive unit.\nTo create hierarchy, a designer must first create a system. A system is\ncreated by logically grouping the elements of a design, either through\nmeaning or function, and forming visual relationships between them. An\neffective design system takes precedence over the individual elements so\nthat the user perceives a cohesive unit. Any element that breaks this system\nwill have more visual value and be understood to have more importance\nthan the other elements, creating a hierarchy.\nFor example, in a classroom where the desks are neatly arranged in five\nrows of five desks and each student is sitting in his or her seat, the students\nappear as a single unit. Regardless of the different genders, clothing, hair\nstyles, or body types, all the students fit within the group because of their\norganization or spatial relationship to one another. If a single student\ndecided to break the system of rows by moving his desk into the aisle, he\nwould stand apart from the system and give himself visual importance over\nthe other students. The students appear as a single unit because of their\narrangement in space\u2014the rows of desks\u2014and the student whose desk is\nnot in line with the others stands out strictly because of his lack of\nrelationship, or his contrast, with the others.\n", "page": 112, "type": "text", "section": "Page 112"}

Great responsive design also takes into account things like page\nload times and typographic legibility to completely change the content and\ndesign of a page for mobile devices. With responsive design a designer can\nhide large imagery on a mobile device, or change the color and size of type\nto increase the contrast and legibility.\nWithout getting too technical, responsive design works through what are\ncalled CSS (cascading style sheet) media queries. These media queries read\na user\u2019s browser data to determine the width of the browser window before\nloading the styling for a page. Currently, there are three primary break\npoints that designers use for their media queries: larger than 768 pixels wide\n(desktop), less than 768 pixels (tablet), and less than 480 pixels wide\n(mobile device).\n", "page": 153, "type": "text", "section": "Page 153"}

Once the width has been\ndetermined, a designer decides how many columns are needed. More\ncolumns means more design flexibility; however, too many columns can\nmake recognizing relationships difficult. There is no right number of\ncolumns, but the optimal grid gives a layout a clear sense of organization\nwhile still allowing for flexibility. The column width for a grid is\ndetermined by the overall width divided by the number of columns. And\nfinally, gutters, or the spaces between the columns, are added, providing\nseparation between the elements in each column.\nA tablet layout (less than 768 but more than 480) shares many relationships\nto the desktop grid. Generally, the number of columns would be reduced by\nhalf and the gutter widths decrease slightly. Often, designers will remove\nthe margin, or space surrounding the page, including a background image or\npattern, to maximize the useable space.\nFinally, a mobile grid (less than 480 pixels wide) is reduced to a single\ncolumn. Given the narrowness of the screen, more than one\u2014or possibly\ntwo\u2014columns causes issues of legibility and usability as design elements,\nincluding buttons, get smaller.

This is because type carries\nthe message, and the craftsmanship of the typography can either enhance or\ntake away from the message. Many designers share a passion for the art of\ntypography and can spend hours kerning letters, adjusting the rag on a\ncolumn of type, or hanging punctuation. With web design, however, this\nlevel of finite control is difficult, or in some cases not possible at all. But\n", "page": 255, "type": "text", "section": "Page 255"}
{"text": "before examining the specific nuances of web type, it\u2019s important to\nunderstand a few universal principals of typography.\nIn historical terms, a font is a complete set of characters that make up a\nsingle size, style, and weight of a typeface. The term typeface refers to the\nunique styling applied to a set of glyphs, including an alphabet of letters and\nligatures, numerals, and punctuation marks. Due largely to their use in\nrelation to computers, the two terms have evolved to be interchangeable. The\nterm font no longer refers to a single size or style, and can even refer to the\ndigital file used by the computer to display typefaces.\nIt has been said that great typography is invisible, but that\u2019s only half the\nstory\u2014 typography can also be beautifully expressive and attention-\ngrabbing. In either case, type must carry a message to the user. The two\nopposing characteristics, which combine to attract a user and convey a\nmessage, are called readability and legibility. Both are essential for effective\ncommunication.\nReadability refers to how well type can attract a reader. Typographic posters,\nbook covers, packaging, logos, and magazine features, for example, must\nhave a readable quality to them in order to get the attention of a reader\u2014a\nquality that makes a person stop and want to read. Readability can come\nfrom size, font usage, composition, color usage, abstraction, or anything that\nhelps type\u2014or, more specifically, the message\u2014 stand apart. Effectively\nreadable type expresses meaning through form beyond the content of the\nwords it displays. The FedEx logo is an example of this idea. The bold,\ngeometric shapes of the letterforms imply stability or reliability, while the\nnegative-space arrow between the capital E and lowercase x implies forward\nmovement and speed\u2014all this with the use of only five letters and two\ncolors.\n", "page": 256, "type": "text", "section": "Page 256"}
{"text": "Legibility, on the other hand, references the ease with which a reader can\ngather a message, especially when it comes to long stretches of copy. The\nrecognizability of individual characters in a font as well as type size,\nleading, letter spacing, line length\u2014even color and backgrounds\u2014play a\nrole in how effectively legible type appears. Truly legible type makes it\npossible for the reader to perceive only content and not be distracted by\nformatting or decoration.\nThese two aspects of type play a big part in effective web typography;\nhowever, the level of control a designer has and the methods he or she uses\nto achieve them can be very different. Readable or expressive typography\ncan be important on the home page to grab the user\u2019s attention, define a\nunique brand characteristic, or alert the reader to a site feature or special\noffer. Legible type is essential for article or blog text and can make the\ndifference in the success of a site that invites users to return to read long\narticles or posts.\n", "page": 257, "type": "text", "section": "Page 257"}
{"text": "House Industries offers hundred of unique fonts for every application. The selection of a typeface can\nhave a significant effect on the overall feel of a web project.\nMeasuring Type\nType and typographic properties such as spacing are commonly\nmeasured in em units. An em is a square unit that represents the\ndistance between baselines when type is set without line spacing or\nleading. An em square is equal to the size of the type; for example, an\nem space for 12 pixel/point type is a 12-pixel square.\nWhile an em is equal to the type size, the individual characters don\u2019t\nnecessarily fit within an em square\u2014 they can be larger or smaller. As\nseen in the diagram below, a Dispatch M fits within a single em unit of\n110 points; however, the Burgues Script M at the same size is not\nconfined to the em unit.\nIn web design\u2014more specifically, CSS styling\u2014type can be defined\nusing em units. Ems are used for relative sizing and for type they\u2019re\nused in the font-size attribute.\nMost browsers default to 16-pixel type as a general rule. So if a\ndesigner specs type at 75 percent, the size of the type will be 12 pixels.\nThe default can also be altered globally by styling the <body> tag. If in\nthe body tag the font size is set to 62.5 percent, then the default for all\ntype on a site is 10 pixels (16 \u00d7 .625 = 10). Therefore, the math for\ndefining other sizes becomes easier: for 15-pixel type the font size\nwould be set to 1.5 em; 24-pixel type would be 2.4 em, etc.\n", "page": 259, "type": "text", "section": "Page 259"}

Using images to display type is a static\nmethod of rendering type\u2014the type is rendered once by the designer or\nproducer, and that image is distributed throughout the web to be viewed by\nthe user.

This chapter explores the\nconsiderations one must make while planning, designing, coding, and\npromoting a site so search engines can find and index it.\nJust like with web design and web usability, search engine optimization\n(SEO) is continually evolving based on trends and market factors. It would\nbe difficult to codify specific techniques in a book whose usefulness is\nintended to last beyond the publication date. Therefore, this chapter focuses\non the conceptual foundation of SEO\u2014the basic principles that form the\ncore of various trends.

Directory sites, however, can provide significant\nSEO value to a site that is listed with them. The inbound links (IBL) from\npopular directories to a site help to dramatically raise that site\u2019s ranking\nwith crawler-based search engines.\nFor the sake of clarity in this chapter, it is important to define a couple of\nterms: a browser is an application installed on the user\u2019s computer and is\nused to browse and display web pages. Some popular browsers are Chrome,\nSafari, and Firefox. A search engine is a website or web utility that catalogs\nsites, through various means, and presents the user with a list of sites that\nare relevant to the user\u2019s search. Some popular search engines are Google,\nYahoo!, and Bing. A browser requires the user to know the exact domain\nname or URL of a site, beginning with www. and ending with .com, .org,\netc., while a search engine requires only that a user have a topic he or she\nwould like to find out more about.\n", "page": 298, "type": "text", "section": "Page 298"}

{"text": "The goal of any search engine is to sort through the millions of sites on the\ninternet and deliver the most popular and relevant sites to a user based on a\nsearch term or phrase. The goal of a webmaster is to stand out from millions\nof sites and get his or her site listed however possible. It\u2019s an ever-evolving\ncat-and-mouse game where the rules change over time.\nEarly search engines relied mostly on site content when developing their\nrankings. A spider would simply read the text and the markup (the tags and\ncode unseen by the user) to determine the content type and quality of a\npage. Some of these hidden bits of markup code include meta keywords,\nwhich can be listed in the <head> tag of the HTML and are intended to be\nthe key terms and phrases used in the content of the page; the meta\ndescription, which is also found in the <head> tag and briefly describes the\ncontent of a page; and alt text (alternative text), which is a written\ndescription of a photo, for example, that can be translated to speech for\nvision-impaired users.\nOne issue with this method of cataloging is that these unseen tags can be\nfilled with irrelevant terms that are nevertheless designed to yield high\ntraffic. Say, for example, a webmaster launched a site for a brand-new\nwidget. It\u2019s unlikely that anyone would be searching for this widget, so he\nmight load the meta tags with terms related to cars\u2014even though his widget\nhas nothing to do with cars\u2014because he knows millions of people search\nfor terms related to cars every day. He may even put some white text talking\nabout cars on his home page on a white background\u2014white on white\nwouldn\u2019t be seen by the user but would be read as content by the spider.\nWithin time, this widget site would begin appearing on searches for \u201ccars\u201d;\nhowever, when a user clicked on the link looking for car information, he or\nshe would be disappointed to see that this site had no actual content related\nto cars\u2014only widgets. This is called spamdexing or Black Hat SEO.\n", "page": 300, "type": "text", "section": "Page 300"}

So-called \u201crich media,\u201d such as\nFlash, audio, and video content, cannot be indexed by search engines using\ntypical methods. Since spiders cannot listen to, watch, or interact with\ncontent, sites that employ rich content were not ranking.\nSearch engines quickly caught on and began adjusting their methods of\nranking sites to reduce spam, detect Black Hat tactics, and increase the\nranking of sites that employed rich media like video. While some search\nengines continue to employ a site\u2019s meta description as the brief blurb under\nthe link on a search results page, meta descriptions are not weighted heavily\nwhen ranking the site. Nor are meta keywords, alt tags, or other elements\nnot seen by the end user, because of the ease with which they can be\nmanipulated. Instead, search engines now use a combination of a site\u2019s\npopularity, in addition to its content, to determine their rank for the site. To\ndo this, search engines not only look at on-site elements like title tags\u2014the\ntext that appears in the top of the browser window\u2014but also off-site factors\nlike the domain name\u2019s age and links from other sites. In fact, off-site\nfactors have a greater effect on a site\u2019s rank than do on-site factors.

The founders of Google developed this method by\nstudying how college theses are evaluated.

Because of the restrictions of mail browsers to display HTML and\nthe need for immediate communication, email templates must focus on simplicity and clear hierarchy.\nThe subject line of an email acts as a headline\nand can play a pivotal role in the success of an\nemail campaign.\nDesigning an email template presents another set of unique design\nchallenges for web designers. This is because email clients (Outlook, Mac\nMail, etc.) are far less sophisticated in their ability to display HTML than\nweb browsers are. For example, the standard width of an email is 600\npixels, as opposed to 990 for a website. File sizes matter, since the user\nhasn\u2019t necessarily requested to see the content of the email. Emails with\nlong load times tend to get deleted and go unread. Emails are primarily\nlimited to HTML and standard image formats\u2014jpg, gif\u2014but Flash,\nJavaScript, and movie formats are currently unsupported by most email\nclients. Linking to external files for styling, for example, is also\nunsupported. Therefore CSS coding must be done \u201cin-line,\u201d meaning in the\nindividual tags for each HTML element.\nThe subject line of an email acts as a headline and can play a pivotal role in\nthe success of an email. Subject lines should speak specifically to the\nsubject of the email with clarity and brevity. Often, as with online banner\nadvertising, multiple subject lines are tested for efficacy, and subject lines\nwith higher open rates can replace more poorly performing lines to\nmaximize the success of an email. Email layouts require simplicity even\nmore so than web pages because they are often scanned by the user. When\ncreating an email, a designer should consider the primary goal of the email\nand focus the design on that element by creating a clear hierarchy of\ninformation. Emails should include at least some HTML-based text because\nsome email clients and mobile devices only display the text of an email.\n", "page": 378, "type": "text", "section": "Page 378"}

And one pays significantly more than the other.\u201d\nFor web designers, this means if you\u2019ve ever started a sentence in a job\ninterview with \u201cI can do [blank] in Adobe XD . . .\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m an Figma expert\n. . .\u201d the unfortunate, and somewhat counterintuitive reality is you fall in\nlatter category of workers who are being run by machines. Limiting your\nskill set to the capabilities of a piece of technology means that anyone who\nwatches a YouTube tutorial video or reads a how-to article can surpass you.\nIt\u2019s the designers who proclaim, \u201cI had a concept for [blank] . . .\u201d or \u201cthe\nstrategy behind this piece is [blank] . . .\u201d that will excel now and in the\nfuture.\n", "page": 394, "type": "text", "section": "Page 394"}
{"text": "After decades of embracing technology as a means of executing design\nconcepts, designers (smart designers) are learning that technology skills on\ntheir own have become a commodity. A commodity is something that has\nno differentiated value, like salt. My accounting professor used to say, \u201cSalt\nis salt no matter who you buy it from, so buy it at the lowest price.\u201d\nDesigners who are run by machines, and base their value on their mastery\nof a piece of software, are finding themselves in a race to the bottom of the\npay scale\u2014\u201cI can do it cheaper than you so pick me.\u201d Not good!\nPerhaps as a result of Mr. Clark\u2019s paradigm, there has been a widening\nschism in the field of graphic design over the past twenty years. On one side\nyou have bargain suppliers of design commodities, on the other you have\nstrategic business partners\u2014 and again, one pays more than the other.\nStrategic design partners understand the context of their work and the\nimpact it will have on business results. Bargain suppliers can create a\nrealistic drop shadow. Strategic design partners can articulate their role in\nthe success of a campaign or a site launch. Commodity suppliers can\narticulate the difference between a PDF and a PNG.\nToday, a student of graphic design will be forced (like it or not) to choose\nwhich side he or she will reside on. The concepts in this book will help\nmove readers toward the former category of those who run machines.\nKnowing the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the \u201chow\u201d is what will separate those who excel\nfrom those who merely work.\n", "page": 395, "type": "text", "section": "Page 395"}
