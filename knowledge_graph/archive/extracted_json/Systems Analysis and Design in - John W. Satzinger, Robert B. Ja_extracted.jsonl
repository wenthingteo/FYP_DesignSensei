Based on the list of system capabilities, the project team \nidentifies these two subsystems:\n \n\u25a0\nSupplier Information Subsystem\n \n\u25a0\nProduct Information Subsystem\nThe Supplier Information Subsystem will collect and maintain information \nabout the manufacturers or wholesalers and the contact people who work for \nthem. The Product Information Subsystem will capture information about the \nvarious products offered by the manufacturers or wholesalers, including de-\ntailed descriptions and photographs.\nProblem Description\nTrade shows have become an important information source for new products, new \nfashions, and new fabrics. In addition to the large providers of outdoor clothing and \nfabrics, there are many smaller providers. It is important for RMO to capture information \nabout these suppliers while the trade show is in progress. It is also important to obtain \ninformation about specific merchandise products that RMO plans to purchase. \nAdditionally, if quality photographs of the products can be obtained while at the trade \nshow, then the creation of online product pages is greatly facilitated.\nIt is recommended that a new system be developed and deployed so field purchasing\nagents can communicate more rapidly with the home office about suppliers and specific\nproducts of interest.

{"text": "features\nThe text describes both predictive and adaptive \napproaches to the SDLC and recommends Agile, \niterative development for most projects. The SDLC \nused in the text features a generic, condensed ver-\nsion of the Unified Process SDLC taught as an Agile \napproach that emphasizes iterations and core de-\nvelopment processes. Core development processes \nand iterations are emphasized over phases to reduce \nthe confusion that ordinarily occurs when students \nare taught \u201cphases\u201d and then told to use iterations. \nProject planning and project management are em-\nphasized throughout, and the book focuses more on \nsystems analysis and systems design as development \ndisciplines rather than phases.\n300\nPART 4 \u25a0 System Development and Project Management\nUsing iterations, the project is able to adapt to any changes as it proceeds. Also, \nparts of the system are available early on for user evaluation and feedback, \nwhich helps ensure that the application will meet the needs of the users.\nYou first saw this concept in the SDLC example used in Chapter 1, which \nis repeated here as Figure 10-5. The core processes defined in Chapter 1 are \ncarried out in each iteration of the project. This iterative approach is adaptive \nbecause with each iteration\u2019s analysis, design, and implementation, modifica-\ntions can be made to adapt to the changing requirements of the project. The \nadaptive approach presented in this textbook is a simplification of and variation \non a more formal iterative approach called the Unified Process (UP). You will \nlearn more about the UP later in this chapter.\nA related concept to an iterative SDLC is called incremental  \ndevelopment. \nIncremental development is always based on an iterative life cycle. The basic \nidea is that the system is built in small increments. An increment may be devel-\noped within a single iteration or it may require two or three iterations. As each \nincrement is completed, it is integrated with the whole. The system, in effect, is \n\u201cgrown\u201d in an organic fashion. The advantage of this approach is that portions \nof the system get into the users\u2019 hands much sooner so the business can begin \naccruing benefits as early as possible.\nYet another related concept, which is also based on an iterative approach, is \nthe idea of a walking skeleton. A walking skeleton, as the name suggests, pro-\nvides a complete front-to-back implementation of the new system but with only \nFigure 10-4 Overlap of system development phases\nAdditional project planning and control tasks\nAnalysis\nDesign\nImplementation\nAdditional analysis tasks\nDeployment\nAdditional design\ntasks\nSupport\n \n=\nDecision points and\ncompletion of major\ncomponents of project\nProject\ninitiation\nProject\nplanning\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCore\nprocesses\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nIdentify the problem and obtain\napproval.\nPlan and monitor project.\nDiscover and understand details.\nDesign system components.\nBuild, test, and integrate system\ncomponents.\nComplete system tests and deploy\nthe solution.\nIterations\nFigure 10-5 Adaptive SDLC with \nsix core processes and multiple \niterations\nincremental development an SDLC \napproach that completes portions of the \nsystem in small increments across iterations, \nwith each increment being integrated into the \nwhole as it is completed\nwalking skeleton a development \napproach in which the complete system \n \nstructure is built but with bare-bones \nfunctionality\n17204_ch10_rev03_293-324.indd   300\n06/12/14   11:12 AM\n163\nCHAPTER 6 \u25a0 Foundations for Systems Design\n \n\u25a0Design Activities\nFigure 6-3 identifies the activities of systems design. This section provides a \nshort introduction to each of these design activities. In-depth explanation and \ninstruction on the specific concepts and skills for each design activity are given \nlater in the text.\nSystems design involves specifying in detail how a system will work when \ndeployed within a specific technology environment. Some of the details may \nhave been defined during systems analysis, but much more detail is added dur-\ning design. In addition, each part of the final solution is heavily influenced by \nthe design of all the other parts. Thus, systems design activities are usually done \nin parallel. For example, the database design influences the design of application \ncomponents, software classes and methods, and the user interface. Likewise, the \ntechnology environment drives many of the decisions for how system functions \nare distributed across application components and how those components com-\nmunicate across a network. When an iterative approach to the SDLC is used, \nmajor design decisions are made in the first or second iteration; however, many \ndecisions are revisited and refined during later iterations.\nTo better understand these design activities, you can summarize each one \nwith a question. In fact, system developers often ask themselves these questions \nto help them stay focused on the objective of each design activity. Figure 6-4 \npresents these questions:\nDesign activities\nDescribe the environment.\nDesign the application components.\nDesign user interface.\nDesign the database.\nDesign the software classes and methods.\nCore\nprocesses\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nIdentify the problem and obtain\napproval.\nPlan and monitor the project.\nDiscover and understand details.\nDesign system components.\nBuild, test, and integrate system\ncomponents.\nComplete system tests and deploy\nthe solution.\nIterations\nFigure 6-3 Design activities\nDesign activity \nDescribe the environment\nDesign the application\ncomponents\nDesign the user interface\nKey question \nHow will this system interact with other systems and with\nthe organization\u2019s existing technologies?\nWhat are the key parts of the information system and how\nwill they interact when the system is deployed?\nDesign the database\nHow will data be captured, structured, and stored for later\nuse by the information system?\nDesign the software classes\nand methods\nWhat internal structure for each application component will\nensure efficient construction, rapid deployment, and reliable\noperation?\nHow will users interact with the information system?\nFigure 6-4 Design activities and \nkey questions\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\n17204_ch06_ptg01_155-184.indd   163\n06/12/14   11:13 AM\nxiv\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

As indicated in \nChapter\u00a02, system developers use a set of models to discover and understand the \nrequirements for a new system. This activity is a key part of systems analysis in \nthe system development process. The first step in the process for developing this \nunderstanding requires the fact-finding skills you learned in Chapter 2. Fact-\nfinding activities are also called discovery activities, and obviously, discovery \nmust precede understanding.\nThe models introduced in Chapters 3 and 4 focus on two primary aspects of \nfunctional requirements: the use cases and the problem domain classes involved \nin users\u2019 work. User stories are sometimes used in place of use cases with Agile \ndevelopment. Use cases are identified by using the user goal technique and the \nOpening case ElEctronics UnlimitEd: intEgrating thE sUpply chain\nElectronics Unlimited is a warehousing distributor that \nbuys electronic equipment from various suppliers and \nsells it to retailers throughout the United States and \nCanada. It has operations and warehouses in Los Ange-\nles, Houston, Baltimore, Atlanta, New York, Denver, and \nMinneapolis. Its customers range from large nationwide \nretailers, such as Target, to medium-sized independent \nelectronics stores.\nMost large retailers have moved toward integrated \nsupply chains. Information systems used to be focused \non processing internal data; however, today, these retail \nchains want suppliers to become part of a totally inte-\ngrated supply chain system. In other words, the systems \nneed to communicate between companies to make the \nsupply chain more efficient.\nTo maintain its position as a leading wholesale dis-\ntributor, Electronics Unlimited has to convert its system to \nlink with its suppliers (the manufacturers of the electronic \nequipment) and its customers (the retailers). It is develop-\ning a completely new system that uses object-oriented \ntechniques to provide these links. Object-oriented tech-\nniques facilitate system-to-system interfaces by using \npredefined components and objects to accelerate the \ndevelopment process. Fortunately, many of the system \ndevelopment staff members have experience with object-\noriented development and are eager to apply the tech-\nniques and models to the system development project.\nWilliam Jones is explaining object-oriented develop-\nment to the group of systems analysts who are being \ntrained in this approach.\n\u201cWe\u2019re developing most of our new systems by \nusing object-oriented principles,\u201d he tells them. \u201cThe \ncomplexity of the new system, along with its interactiv-\nity, makes the object-oriented approach a natural way to \ndevelop requirements. The object-oriented models track \nvery closely with the new object-oriented programming \nlanguages and frameworks.\u201d\nWilliam is just getting warmed up.\n\u201cThis way of thinking about a system in terms of \nobjects is very interesting,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is also consis-\ntent with the object-oriented programming techniques \nyou learned in your programming classes. You prob-\nably first learned to think about objects when you de-\nveloped screens for the user interface. All the controls \non the screen, such as buttons, text boxes, and drop-\ndown boxes, are objects. Each has its own set of trigger \nevents that activate its program functions.\u201d\n\u201cHow does this apply to our situation?\u201d one of the \nanalysts asks.\n\u201cYou just extend that thought process,\u201d William \nexplains.\u201d You think of such things as purchase orders \nand employees as objects, too. We can call them the \nproblem domain objects to differentiate them from user-\ninterface objects, such as windows and buttons. During \nanalysis, we have to find out all the trigger events and \nmethods associated with each business object.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how do we do that?\u201d another analyst asks.\n\u201cYou continue with your fact-finding activities and \nbuild a better understanding of each use case,\u201d William \nsays. \u201cThe way the problem domain objects interact \nwith each other in the use case determines how you \nidentify the initiating activity. We refer to those activi-\nties as the messages between objects. The tricky part \nis that you need to think in terms of objects instead of \njust processes. Sometimes, it helps me to pretend I am \nan object. I will say, \u2018I am a purchase order object. What \nfunctions and services are other objects going to ask me \nto do?\u2019 After you get the hang of it, it works very well, \nand it is enlightening to see how the system require-\nments unfold as you develop the diagrams.\u201d\n17204_ch05_ptg01_131-154.indd   132\n06/12/14   12:32 PM\nEach chapter provides a \nchapter outline, states \nclear learning objectives, \nand includes an opening \ncase study.\nxv\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

These indicate the \nfeatures that must be present for the user to be satisfied with the resulting imple-\nmentation. They focus on functionality, not on features or user-interface design. \nFor example, the following are the acceptance criteria for the user story \u201cbank \nteller making a deposit\u201d:\n1. Customer lookup must be by name or by account number.\n2. It would be nice to display photo and signature of customer.\n3. Any check hold requirements must be indicated.\n4. Current balance and new balance must be displayed.\nThe programmer analyst uses the acceptance criteria to clarify the expec-\ntations of the user and to verify the user is looking at the user story at an \nappropriate level of analysis. When the user story is implemented and refined, \nthe acceptance criteria are used for testing. Some consider it much like a con-\ntract between the developers and the users that limits controversy later in the \nproject. Figure 3-1 shows two user stories handwritten on index cards. The \nfirst user story is for the bank teller example just discussed. The other user \nstory is for a shipping clerk responsible for shipping the items on a new order \nfor RMO.\nUser Story\nAs a teller, I want to make a deposit to quickly serve more customers.\nAcceptance Criteria:\n1.

Similarly, working with the \nteam leaders, team members, internal technical staff, and any subcontractors is an \nimportant part of a project manager\u2019s internal responsibilities. The\u00a0project man-\nager must ensure that all internal and external communication is flowing properly. \nFigure 11-2 depicts the various groups of people involved in a development project.\n \n\u25a0Project Management and Ceremony\nAnother dimension that has a heavy impact on project management is the level \nof formality, sometimes called ceremony, required for a given project. Level of \nformality or ceremony is a measure of the amount of documentation gener-\nated, the traceability of specifications, and the formality of the project\u2019s deci-\nsion-making processes. Some projects, particularly small ones, are conducted \nwith very low ceremony. Meetings occur in the hallway or around the water \ncooler. Written documentation, formal specifications, and detailed models are \nkept to a minimum. Developers and users usually work closely together on a \ndaily basis to define requirements and develop the system. Other projects, usu-\nally larger, more complex ones, are executed with high ceremony. Meetings \nare often held on a predefined schedule, with specific participants, agendas, \nminutes, and follow-through. Specifications are formally documented with an \nLevel of formality or ceremony the rigor \nof holding formal meetings and producing \ndetailed documentation\nFigure 11-2 Stakeholders in a system development project\nProject manager\nClient\nExternal\nstakeholders\nUser\nOversight committee\nInternal\nstakeholders\nUser\nTechnical staff\nMember\nMember\nMember\nMember\nMember\nTeam leader\nSubcontractor\nTeam leader\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\n17204_ch11_rev03_325-362.indd   330\n06/12/14   10:34 AM\nxvi\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "features\n393\nCHAPTER 12 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Fundamentals\nis refined and expanded as the sequence diagrams are \ndeveloped. One method of determining which objects \ncollaborate is to use class responsibility collaboration \n(CRC) cards. For simple use cases, a set of CRC cards \nmay be sufficient to write code. For more complex use \ncases, other interaction diagrams are normally used.\nOne reason that we suggest a more formal system \nof design, rather than just starting to write code is \nthat the final system is much more robust and main-\ntainable. Design as a rigorous activity builds better \nsystems. Some fundamental principles should be con-\nsidered as a system is developed; specifically, two criti-\ncal ideas are coupling and cohesion. A good system \nhas low coupling between the classes, and each of the \nclasses has high cohesion. Another important principle \nis \u201cprotection from variations,\u201d meaning that some \nparts of the system should be protected from and not \ntightly coupled to other parts of the system that are \nless stable and subject to change. Being a good devel-\noper entails learning and following the principles of \ngood design.\nThe ultimate responsibility of system developers is to \nwrite computer software that solves a business prob-\nlem. This chapter focuses on how to configure and \ndevelop the solution system\u2014that is, how to design \nthe details of the new system. Systems design is the \nbridge that puts business requirements in terms that \nthe programmers can use to write the software that \nbecomes the solution system.\nUsing all the requirements models as well as the \narchitectural design, object-oriented design extends \nthe models so programming can proceed. The objec-\ntive of object-oriented design is to determine the \nmethods within individual classes that are needed to \nimplement the use cases. The process of design is use-\ncase-driven, in that it is done one use case at a time.\nThe process of object-oriented design can be \ndivided into two major areas: developing a design class \ndiagram (DCD) and identifying the methods for each \nuse case via an interaction diagram. The DCD is usu-\nally developed in two steps. A first-cut DCD is created \nbased on the domain model class diagram, but then it \nCHAPTER Summary\ndata access class\nentity class\nindirection\ninstantiation\nmethod signature\nnavigation visibility\nobject-oriented design\nobject responsibility\npersistent class\nprotection from variations\nseparation of responsibilities\nstereotype\nvisibility\nboundary or view class\nclass-level attribute\nclass-level method\ncohesion\ncontroller class\ncoupling\nCRC (class responsibility \ncollaboration) cards\nKEy TermS\n \n1.

Complete a fully developed use case descrip-\ntion for each scenario.\nQuality Building Supply has two kinds of \ncustomers: contractors and the general public. \nSales to each are slightly different.\nA contractor buys materials by taking them \nto the checkout desk for contractors. The clerk \nenters the contractor\u2019s name into the system. \nThe system displays the contractor\u2019s informa-\ntion, including current credit standing. The clerk \nthen opens up a new ticket (sale) for the contrac-\ntor. Next, the clerk scans in each item to be pur-\nchased. The system finds the price of the item \nand adds the item to the ticket. At the end of the \npurchase, the clerk indicates the end of the sale. \nThe system compares the total amount against \nthe contractor\u2019s current credit limit and, if it is \nacceptable, finalizes the sale. The system creates \nan electronic ticket for the items, and the con-\ntractor\u2019s credit limit is reduced by the amount of \nthe sale. Some contractors like to keep a record \nof their purchases, so they request that ticket \ndetails be printed. Others aren\u2019t interested in a \nprintout.\nA sale to the general public is simply entered \ninto the cash register, and a paper ticket is \nprinted as the items are identified. Payment can \nbe made by cash, check, or credit card. The clerk \nmust enter the type of payment to ensure that \nthe cash register balances at the end of the shift. \nFor credit card payments, the system prints a \ncredit card voucher that the customer must sign.\n \n2. Based on the following narrative, develop either \nan activity diagram or a fully developed descrip-\ntion for the use case of Add a new vehicle to an \nexisting policy in a car insurance system.\nA customer calls a clerk at the insurance \ncompany and gives his policy number. The clerk \nenters this information, and the system displays \nthe basic insurance policy. The clerk then checks \nthe information to make sure the premiums are \ncurrent and the policy is in force.\nThe customer gives the make, model, year, \nand vehicle identification number (VIN) of the \ncar to be added. The clerk enters this informa-\ntion, and the system ensures that the given data \nare valid. Next, the customer selects the types \nof coverage desired and the amount of each. \nThe clerk enters the information, and the system \nrecords it and validates the requested amount \nagainst the policy limits. After all the cover-\nages have been entered, the system ensures the \ntotal coverage against all other ranges, including \nother cars on the policy. Finally, the customer \nmust identify all the drivers and the percent-\nage of time they drive the car. If a new driver is \nto be added, then another use case\u2014Add new \ndriver\u2014is invoked.\nAt the end of the process, the system up-\ndates the policy, calculates a new premium \namount, and prints the updated policy statement \nto be mailed to the policy owner.\n \n3.

Compare your findings with \nthe techniques taught in this chapter.\nTheEyesHaveIt.com Book Exchange\nTheEyesHaveIt.com Book Exchange is a type of e-busi-\nness exchange that does business entirely on the Internet. \nThe company acts as a clearinghouse for buyers and sell-\ners of used books.\nTo offer books for sale, a person must register with \nTheEyesHaveIt.com. The person must provide a current \nphysical address and telephone number as well as a cur-\nrent e-mail address. The system then maintains an open \naccount for this person. Access to the system as a seller is \nthrough a secure, authenticated portal.\nA seller can list books on the system through a special \nInternet form. The form asks for all the pertinent informa-\ntion about the book: its category, its general condition, and \nthe asking price. A seller may list as many books as de-\nsired. The system maintains an index of all books in the \nsystem so buyers can use the search engine to search for \nbooks. The search engine allows searches by title, author, \ncategory, and keyword.\nPeople who want to buy books come to the site and \nsearch for the books they want. When they decide to buy, \nthey must open an account with a credit card to pay for the \nbooks. The system maintains all this information on secure \nservers.\nWhen a purchase is made, TheEyesHaveIt.com sends \nan e-mail notice to the seller of the book that was chosen \nas well as payment information. It also marks the book as \nsold. The system maintains an open order until it receives \nnotice that the book has been shipped. After the seller re-\nceives notice that a listed book has been sold, the seller \nmust notify the buyer via e-mail within 48 hours that the \npurchase is noted. Shipment of the order must be made \nwithin 24 hours after the seller sends the notification e-\nmail. The seller sends a notification to the buyer and The-\nEyesHaveIt.com when the shipment is made.\nAfter receiving the notice of shipment, TheEyesHaveIt.\ncom maintains the order in a shipped status. At the end of \neach month, a check is mailed to each seller for the book \norders that have remained in a shipped status for 30 days. \nThe 30-day waiting period exists to allow the buyer to no-\ntify TheEyesHaveIt.com if the shipment doesn\u2019t arrive for \nsome reason or if the book isn\u2019t in the same condition as \nadvertised.\nIf they want, buyers can enter a service code for the \nseller. The service code is an indication of how well the \nseller is servicing book purchases. Some sellers are very \nactive and use TheEyesHaveIt.com as a major outlet for \nselling books. Thus, a service code is an important indica-\ntor to potential buyers.\nFor this case, develop these diagrams:\n1. \nA domain model class diagram\n2. \nA list of uses cases and a use case diagram\n3. \nA fully developed description for two use cases:  \nAdd a seller and Record a book order\n4. \nAn SSD for each of the two use cases: Add a seller \nand Record a book order\nCASE STUDY\nCommunity Board of Realtors\u00ae\nThe Multiple Listing Service system has a number of \nuse cases, which you identified in Chapter 3, and three \nkey domain classes, which you identified in Chapter 4: \nRealEstateOffice, Agent, and Listing.\n \n1.

{"text": "xviii\nPREFACE\nWhen we wrote the first edition of this textbook, the world of system devel-\nopment was in a major transition period\u2014from structured methodologies to \nobject-oriented methodologies. We were among the first to introduce a compre-\nhensive treatment of object-oriented methodologies, and Systems Analysis and \nDesign in a Changing World, Seventh Edition, continues to be the leader in \nteaching UML and object-oriented techniques.\nHowever, change continues. Today, many new initiatives and trends have \nbecome firmly embedded in the world of system development. First and fore-\nmost is the ubiquitous access to the Internet throughout the global economy. \nThe resulting explosion of connectivity means that project teams are now dis-\ntributed around the world. In addition, large providers (such as Microsoft) and a \nproliferation of small providers now contribute to a wonderfully rich and varied \nsoftware development environment.\nIn order to manage system development teams in today\u2019s distributed, fast-\npaced, connected, ever-changing environment, the techniques for software de-\nvelopment and the approach to project management have expanded. Along with \nthe foundational project management principles, additional approaches and \nphilosophies provide new, success-oriented methodologies, such as Agile itera-\ntive, incremental development approaches. These are thoroughly covered in this \nedition.\nEven though Systems Analysis and Design in a Changing World, Seventh \nEdition, continues to be the leader in its field, with thorough treatment of such \ntopics as user stories, use cases, object-oriented modeling, comprehensive project \nmanagement, the Unified Modeling Language, and Agile techniques, it was time \nto take another step forward in textbook design. This edition uses an innovative \napproach to teaching systems analysis and design, taking advantage of the new \nteaching tools and techniques that are now available. As a result, not only is sys-\ntems analysis and design easier to learn by using this approach, it is also easier \nto teach. It brings together the best approaches for teachers and students.\nIn this edition, we accomplish four major new objectives. First, we teach all \nthe essential principles of system development\u2014principles that must be followed \nin today\u2019s connected environment. Second, we teach and explain the new meth-\nodologies and techniques that are now available because of widespread connec-\ntivity. Third, we have organized and revamped the textbook so that it teaches \nthese new concepts in a new way. Fourth, we created a set of short videos that \nexplain key concepts and walk the reader through UML diagrams to help with \nunderstanding complex modeling. \nFor example, Chapter 1 presents a complete iteration in the development \nof a new system. Students get to see that complete iteration\u2014from beginning \nto end (through implementation and testing)\u2014before having to learn abstract \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Also, the newly written running cases through-\nout the book focus on current issues of communication and connectedness \nand take\u00a0the students through all aspects of system development. We have also \nexpanded the Instructor\u2019s Materials and enhanced the aids available through \nCourseMate, our online resource. Additional online chapters are also available \nto enhance and extend the learning experience.\nFinally, we updated and enhanced the set of over 30 short videos that ex-\nplain key concepts in the text. These videos have been very well received and are \neven better with the new edition. These videos are useful for blended and online \nclasses as well as traditional classes. The videos range from 3 to 10 minutes, \nand provide just-in-time explanations for often difficult to understand concepts, \nsuch as iterative development and Agile development, and illustrate important \ntechniques such as identifying user stories and use cases. Most importantly, the \nvideos show by demonstration how to read and interpret important UML mod-\nels such as the domain model class diagrams, use case diagrams, sequence dia-\ngrams, and package diagrams. Understanding detailed UML models is finally \npossible in a way no other text can match. \nWe are excited about this new approach. The time is right for new materials \nand new tools for teaching systems analysis and design. Instructors will find this \ntextbook intuitive, powerful, and easy to use. Students will find it engaging and \nempowering. Many concepts are presented so the students can teach themselves, \nwith coaching and direction provided by the professor. It will be an rewarding \nexperience to teach and learn with this textbook.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Innovations\nThis edition is innovative in many respects. It includes key concepts from tra-\nditional and object-oriented approaches, covers the use case-driven approach \n(with UML modeling being detailed in depth), emphasizes Agile and iterative \ndevelopment, and incorporates the latest concepts in Agile project management. \nAlso, the material is completely reorganized to better support learning systems \nanalysis and design.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Coverage of Object Orientation and Traditional Analysis  \nand Design\nThis textbook is unique in its integration of key systems-modeling concepts that \napply to the traditional structured approach and the object-oriented approach\u2014\nuser goals and events that trigger system use cases, plus classes of objects/data \nentities that are part of the system\u2019s problem domain. We devote one chapter \nto identifying user stories and use cases and another chapter to modeling key \nobjects/entities, including coverage of entity-relationship diagrams, while em-\nphasizing UML domain model class diagrams. After completing these chap-\nters, instructors can cover structured analysis and design by including an online \nchapter, or they can focus on object-oriented analysis and design by using the \nchapters in this textbook. It is assumed from the beginning that everyone should \nunderstand the key object-oriented concepts. The traditional approach isn\u2019t dis-\ncarded; key structured concepts are still included. But these days, most instruc-\ntors are emphasizing the object-oriented approach.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Full Coverage of UML and the Object-Oriented Approach\nThe object-oriented approach presented in this textbook is based on the Unified \nModeling Language (UML 2.0) from the Object Management Group, as origi-\nnated by Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson. A model-driven \napproach to analysis starts with user stories and use cases and then defines \nproblem domain classes involved in the users\u2019 work.

The FURPS+ model is used to \nemphasize functional and nonfunctional requirements.\nDesign principles and design patterns are discussed in depth, and system \narchitecture is modeled by using UML component diagrams and package dia-\ngrams. Detailed design models are also discussed in detail, with particular at-\ntention given to use case realization with CRC cards, sequence diagrams, and \ndesign class diagrams.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Project Management Coverage\nMany undergraduate programs depend on their systems analysis and design \ncourse to teach project management principles. To satisfy this need, we cover \nproject management by taking a four-pronged approach. First, specific project \nmanagement techniques, skills, and tasks are included and highlighted through-\nout this book. This integration teaches students how to apply specific project \nmanagement tasks to the various activities of the system development life cycle \n(SDLC), including iterative development. Second, complete coverage of project \nplanning and project management is included in a separate chapter. Third, we \ninclude a 120-day trial version of Microsoft Project Professional in the back of \nthis book so students can obtain hands-on experience with this important tool. \nFourth, a more in-depth treatment of project management techniques and prin-\nciples is provided in an online chapter on this book\u2019s Web site. This information \nis based on the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), as devel-\noped by the Project Management Institute\u2014the primary professional organiza-\ntion for project managers in the United States.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Organized for More Effective Learning\nThis edition\u2019s innovative and entirely new organization starts with a complete \nbeginning-to-end example of system development, moves immediately to sys-\ntems analysis models and techniques, and then proceeds to system design con-\ncepts, emphasizing system architecture, user interfaces, and database design. \nThe student sees analysis and much of design covered in the first nine chap-\nters. Next, the text focuses on managing system development projects, including \n\u00ad\nAgile development, after the student has had a chance to understand what is \nactually involved in system development.

The \ncurrent printed textbook provides a focused presentation of those topics that are \nessential and most important for information systems developers. The online \nchapters extend those concepts and provide a broader presentation of several \ntopics. The online chapters may be integrated into the course or simply used as \nadditional readings as prescribed by the instructor.\nThere are three major subject areas discussed in this book: systems analy-\nsis, systems design, and project management. There are additional subject areas, \nwhich are no less important but aren\u2019t discussed in as much depth. These include \nsystems implementation, testing, and deployment. In addition, we have taken \nan approach that is quite different from other texts. Because students already \nhave a basic understanding of systems analysis and design from Chapter 1, we \nimmediately present in-depth concepts related to systems analysis and design. \nWe present approaches to development and project management topics later in \nthe text. This allows students to learn those project management concepts after \nunderstanding the elements of systems analysis and design. We think it will be \nmore meaningful for students at that point in the course.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Part 1: Introduction to System Development\nPart 1, comprising Online Chapter A and Chapter 1, presents an overview of \nsystem development. Online Chapter A, \u201cThe Role of the Systems Analyst,\u201d \ndescribes basic systems concepts and the role of the systems analyst in system \ndevelopment projects. Chapter 1 begins by briefly explaining the objectives of \nsystems analysis and systems design. Then, it provides a detailed, concrete ex-\nample of what is required in a typical software development project. Many stu-\ndents who take a programming class think that programming is all you need \nto develop software and deploy a system. This chapter and the rest of the book \nshould dispel that myth.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Part 2: Systems Analysis Tasks\nChapters 2 through 5 cover systems analysis in detail. Chapter 2 discusses sys-\ntem requirements, analysis activities, and techniques for gathering information \nabout the business problem.

{"text": "xxii\nPREFACE\nif the problem is accurately understood. Chapter 2 also explains how to identify \nand involve the stakeholders and introduces the concept of models and mod-\neling. Chapters 3 and 4 teach modeling techniques for capturing the detailed \nrequirements for the system in a useful form. When discussing an information \nsystem, two key concepts are particularly useful: the user stories/use cases that \ndefine what the end users need the system to do and the data entities/domain \nclasses that users work with while carrying out their work tasks. These two \n\u00ad\nconcepts\u2014user stories/use cases and data entities/domain classes\u2014are impor-\ntant no matter what approach to system development is being used. Chapter 5 \npresents more in-depth requirements models, such as use case descriptions, ac-\ntivity diagrams, system sequence diagrams, and CRUD analysis.\nOnline Chapter B, \u201cThe Traditional Approach to Requirements,\u201d presents \nthe traditional, structured approach to developing systems. To those instructors \nand students who desire to learn about data flow diagrams and structured Eng-\nlish, this chapter provides an in-depth presentation.\nAll these modeling techniques provide in-depth analysis of user needs and \nallow the analyst to develop requirements and specifications. Again, the purpose \nof systems analysis is to thoroughly understand and specify the user\u2019s needs and \nrequirements.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Part 3: Essentials of Systems Design\nPart 3 provides the fundamental concepts related to systems design and design-\ning the user experience. Chapter 6 provides broad and comprehensive coverage \nof important principles of systems design, including design activities and the \ncrucial issues of system controls and security that all students should under-\nstand. It serves not only as a broad overview of design principles but also as a \nfoundation for later chapters that explain the detailed techniques, tasks, skills, \nand models used to carry out design.\nChapter 7 provides a comprehensive overview of system architecture and \nis a new chapter that consolidates material previously spread out in multiple \nchapters. Chapter 8 presents additional design principles related to the user ex-\nperience. Designing the user interface is a combination of analysis and design. \nIt is related to analysis because it requires heavy user involvement and includes \nspecifying user activities and desires. On the other hand, it is a design activity \nbecause it is creating specific final components that are used to drive the pro-\ngramming effort. The screens and reports and other user interaction compo-\nnents must be precisely designed so they can be programmed as part of the final \nsystem. Chapter 9 provides a compact and integrated coverage of designing the \ndatabase.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Part 4: Projects and Project Management\nBy this point, students will have a basic understanding of all the elements of \nsystem development. Part 4 brings together all these concepts by explaining \nmore about the process of organizing and managing development projects. \nChapter 10 describes different approaches to system development in today\u2019s en-\nvironment, including Agile development and several widely used development \n\u00ad\nmethodologies\u2014the Unified Process, Extreme Programming, and Scrum. It is \nan important chapter to help you understand how projects actually get executed.\nChapter 11 extends these concepts by teaching foundation principles of \nproject planning and project management.

For those instructors and \nstudents who would like to learn specific project management skills, this is an \nimportant chapter.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Part 5: Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nPart 5 goes into more depth with respect to systems design, specifically object-\noriented software design, and other important issues related to effective and suc-\ncessful system development and deployment.\nChapters 12 and 13 explain in detail the models, skills, and techniques used \nto design software systems. As mentioned earlier, systems design is a fairly com-\nplex activity, especially if it is done correctly. The objective of these two chapters \nis to teach the student the various techniques\u2014from simple to complex\u2014that \ncan be used to effectively design software systems.\nChapter 14 describes the final elements in system development: final testing, \ndeployment, maintenance, and version control.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Designing Your Analysis and Design Course\nThere are many approaches to teaching analysis and design courses, and the \nobjectives of the course differ considerably from college to college. In some ac-\nademic information systems departments, the analysis and design course is a \ncapstone course in which students apply the material learned in prior database, \nnetworking, and programming courses to a real analysis and design project. In \nother information systems departments, analysis and design is used as an intro-\nduction to the field of system development and is taken prior to more specialized \ncourses. Some information systems departments offer a two-course sequence \nemphasizing analysis in the first semester and design and implementation in the \nsecond semester. Some information systems departments have only one course \nthat covers analysis and design.\nThe design of the analysis and design course is complicated even more by \nthe choice of emphasizing some traditional and some object-oriented content\u2014\nagain, depending on local curriculum priorities. Additionally, the more iterative \napproach to development in general has made choices about sequencing the anal-\nysis and design topics more difficult. For example, with iterative development, a \ntwo-course sequence can\u2019t be divided into analysis and then design as easily.\nThe objectives, course content, assignments, and projects have many varia-\ntions. What we offer below are some suggestions for using this textbook in vari-\nous approaches to the course.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0UML and Object-Oriented Analysis and Design Course\nThis is the course we designed the printed textbook to support, so all the printed \nchapters but none of the online chapters are included. Note that object-oriented \ndesign is included in detail. The course covers object-oriented analysis and de-\nsign, user and system interface design, database design, controls and security, \nand implementation and testing. It is usually assumed that the projects will use \ncustom development, including Web development. The course emphasizes itera-\ntive development with three-layer architecture, project management, informa-\ntion gathering, and management reporting. One-semester courses are usually \nlimited to completing some prototypes of the user interface to give students \nclosure. Sometimes, this course is spread over two semesters, with some imple-\nmentation of an actual system in the second semester for a more complete devel-\nopment experience. Iterative development is emphasized.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

{"text": "4\nPART 1 \u25a0 Introduction to System Development\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Software Development and Systems Analysis \nand Design\nYou have grown up in a world of ubiquitous computing, where computers are \neverywhere and are increasingly characterized by mobility, communication, and \nconnectivity. You use smartphones, laptops, notepads, and wearable devices \nthroughout the day. Some of you have already developed your own application \nsoftware or have friends who have written applications for these devices. Some \nof you have taken programming classes; others have taught yourself how to \nwrite computer application programs. In one way or another, you are certainly \ninterested in building computer applications and information systems.\nAlthough you are most likely more familiar with your mobile devices, there \nis much more to building information systems than just that. Information sys-\ntems exist to support all aspects of business organizations and have done so for \ncenturies. The ancient Mesopotamians conducted business and had accounting \ninformation systems 3,000 years ago\u2014using clay tablet technology. \u00ad\nElectronic \ncomputers have been a part of these information systems only for the last \n50\u00a0years. The technology changes, but information systems have a long history.\nAn information system is a set of interrelated components that collect, \nprocess, store, and provide as output the information needed to complete busi-\nness tasks. The information system always includes people who operate the sys-\ntem and carry out some of the work. In Mesopotamia, people did just about all \nof the work required. Now, of course, electronic computing devices do most of \nthe work, although not all. If you are at the library typing in some search terms \nusing the online catalog, you are part of the information system\u2014the part that \nsupplies the input and consumes the output. If you are using your bank\u2019s online \ninformation system, you are part of the information system\u2014the part that se-\nlects which account to use to pay a specific bill.\nMore recently, another term has been used to refer to an information \n\u00ad\nsystem\u2014a computer application. A computer application is a computer soft-\nware program that executes on a computing device to carry out a specific func-\ntion or set of related functions. Sometimes, computer application is shortened \nto app (such as an iPhone app or an Android app). Many people use the terms \ninformation system and computer application interchangeably, but remember \nthat an information system includes people and their manual procedures and an \napplication usually refers just to the software.\nConsider the information system your university or college uses to support \nstudents. It is an elaborate system that likely integrates admissions, financial \naid, course scheduling, and even individual course support. You probably access \nthis information system through the network using a desktop workstation at \nhome or in a computer lab, a wireless notebook computer, an iPad or tablet, an \niPhone or an Android phone, and even a wearable device such as a smartwatch \nor Google Glass. There might be an app that connects to the system seamlessly \nfrom your device, or you might connect through a browser on your desktop, \nnotebook, or other devices. Figure 1-1 shows a variety of devices all connecting \nto the same University Student Support System.\nEach information system (or app) was conceived and built to satisfy some \nneed. When the information system is completed, it is used productively to sat-\nisfy that need. Our purpose here is to describe the process by which an informa-\ntion system is created from perceived need through actual use. As noted in this \nchapter\u2019s title, systems analysis and systems design are key components of this \nprocess.\nSystems analysis consists of those activities that enable a person to under-\nstand and specify what the new system should accomplish. The operative words \nhere are understanding and specifying. Systems analysis is more than a brief \ninformation system\u2003 a set of interrelated \ncomponents that collect, process, store, and \nprovide as output the information needed to \ncomplete business tasks\ncomputer application or app\u2003 a computer \nsoftware program that executes on a comput-\ning device to carry out a specific function or \nset of related functions\nsystems analysis\u2003 those system \n\u00ad\ndevelopment activities that enable a person \nto understand and specify what the new \n\u00ad\nsystem should accomplish\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

In this scenario, there is the owner of the\u00a0land \nwho has the vision, the builder who will construct the building, and the archi-\ntect who serves as the bridge between the owner and the builder. The\u00a0\u00ad\narchitect \nhelps the owner develop the vision, but must also communicate the building\u2019s \nspecifications to the builder. In doing so, the architect uses various tools to \nfirst capture the vision from the owner and to then provide the builder with \ninstructions\u2014including line drawings, blueprints, to-scale models, detail speci-\nfications, and even on-site inspection reports.\nJust as a builder doesn\u2019t start construction without plans, programmers \ndon\u2019t just sit down and start writing program code. They need someone (maybe \nthemselves) to function like an architect\u2014planning, capturing the vision, un-\nderstanding details, specifying needs\u2014before designing and writing the code \nthat satisfies the vision. Usually, we call this person a systems analyst. In sit-\nuations where you are the programmer as well as the analyst (often called a \nprogrammer-analyst), it might be possible to keep track of the details without \nmany formal notes. However, in today\u2019s world, with system development teams \noften distributed worldwide, you might only be responsible for part of the pro-\ngramming, with the rest handled by team members in different locations.

{"text": "7\nCHAPTER 1 \u25a0 From Beginning to End: An Overview of Systems Analysis and Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)\nInitial development of a new information system is usually done as a project. \nA\u00a0project is a planned undertaking that has a beginning and an end and pro-\nduces some end result. This means that the activities required to develop a new \nsystem are identified, planned, organized, and monitored. Some projects are \nvery formal, whereas others are informal, usually depending on the project size.\nTo manage a project with analysis, design, and other development activi-\nties, you need a project management framework to guide and coordinate the \nwork of the project team. The system development life cycle (SDLC) is a \nframework that identifies all the activities required to research, build, deploy, \nand often maintain an information system. Normally, the SDLC includes all ac-\ntivities needed for the planning, systems analysis, systems design, programming, \ntesting, and user training stages of information systems development, as well as \nother project management activities that are required to successfully deploy the \nnew information system.\nThere are many approaches to the SDLC, including variations specific to cer-\ntain types of projects. However, every SDLC includes some core processes that \nare always required, though many different names are used. Here are the six core \nprocesses required in the development of any information system (see Figure 1-4):\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIdentify the problem or need and obtain approval to proceed with the project.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPlan and monitor the project\u2014what to do, how to do it, and who does it.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDiscover and understand the details of the problem or the need\u2014what is \nrequired?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDesign the system components that solve the problem or satisfy the need\u2014\nhow will it actually work?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nBuild, test, and integrate system components\u2014lots of programming and \ncomponent integration.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nComplete system tests and then deploy the solution\u2014the need now is \nsatisfied.\nAs previously stated, most information systems you will develop are con-\nceived and built to solve complex organizational problems, which are usually \nvery complex, thus making it difficult to plan and manage a system development \nproject. Fortunately, there are many ways to implement the six core processes of \nthe SDLC to handle each project\u2019s complexity.

These are all based on what is called Agile \ndevelopment. The basic philosophy of Agile development is that neither team \nmembers nor the users completely understand the problems and complexities \nof a new system, so the project plan and the execution of the project must be \nresponsive to unanticipated issues. The plan must be agile and flexible. It must \nhave procedures in place to allow for, anticipate, and even embrace changes and \nnew requirements that come up during the development process. The six core \nprocesses are still involved in Agile development, but they are carried out itera-\ntively, as explained next.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Iterative Development\nIterative development is an approach to system development in which the sys-\ntem is \u201cgrown\u201d in an almost organic fashion. Core components are developed \nfirst and then additional components are added. It is called iterative because the \nsix core development processes are repeated for each component. In\u00a0other words, \nthere is one big project, which consists of a series of mini-projects, and the in-\nformation system is grown piece by piece during these mini-projects. \u00ad\nIterative \ndevelopment makes Agile development possible, although Agile development in-\ncludes additional techniques that help with project flexibility, too.\nFigure 1-5 illustrates how an iterative project might be managed. Across \nthe figure, you see six iterations as columns. Each iteration involves all six core \nprocesses, shown as rows in the table. At the end of each iteration, a working \npart of the system is completed and evaluated. An iteration lasts a fixed period \nof time, usually two to four weeks. The rounded mounds inside the graph rep-\nresent the relative amount of effort for that core process during that iteration. \nFor example, in Figure 1\u20135, Iteration 1 appears to primarily focus on identify-\ning the problem and planning the project. Lesser amounts of discovery, design, \nand build/test may also be done. For this iteration, nothing is done with regard \nto deploying the system. In Iteration 2, there is less effort for identifying the \nproblem and planning the project and more effort for discovery, design, and \nbuild/test. By Iteration 3, build/test gets the most effort, but all six core pro-\ncesses are still involved, including the beginnings of completing and deploying \nthe system.\nAgile development\u2003 an information system \ndevelopment process that emphasizes flexibil-\nity and rapid response to anticipate new and \nchanging requirements during development\nCore\nprocesses\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nIdentify the problem and obtain\napproval.\nPlan and monitor the project.\nDiscover and understand details.\nDesign system components.\nBuild, test, and integrate system\ncomponents.\nComplete system tests and\ndeploy the solution.\nIterations\nFigure 1-5\u2009\nThe six core processes \nof the SDLC showing iterations\nIterative development\u2003 an approach to \nsystem development in which the system is \n\u201cgrown\u201d piece by piece through multiple mini-\nprojects called iterations\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "9\nCHAPTER 1 \u25a0 From Beginning to End: An Overview of Systems Analysis and Design\nThere are several benefits to iterative development. For one, portions of the \nsystem can sometimes be deployed sooner. If there are core functions that pro-\nvide basic support for users, these can be deployed in an early iteration. Second, \nby taking a small portion and developing it first, the most difficult problems can \nbe identified and addressed early in the project. Many of today\u2019s systems are so \nlarge and complex that even with a formal process it is impossible to remember \nand understand everything. By focusing on only a small portion at a time, the \nrequirements are fewer and easier to solve. Finally, developing a system in itera-\ntions makes the entire development process more flexible and able to address \nnew requirements and issues that come up throughout the project.\nA key element of iterative development is dividing system components into \npieces that can be completed in two to four weeks. During one iteration, all the \ncore development processes are involved, including programming and system-\nwide testing, so the result is a working part of the system, even though it may \nonly have a portion of the functionality that is ultimately required. Developers \nchoose components for each iteration based on priority, either the components \nmost needed or riskiest to implement.\nTo better illustrate these concepts, we will walk through a complete ex-\nample in the next sections concerning Ridgeline Mountain Outfitters (RMO). \nThese sections use a fairly small information system to demonstrate all six core \nprocesses (as much as is feasible in a textbook, anyway). The example completes \none iteration in detail, but the project actually requires multiple iterations. By \ngoing all the way through a very simple project, you will more easily understand \nthe complex concepts provided in the rest of the text.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Introduction to Ridgeline Mountain \nOutfitters\u00a0(RMO)\nRidgeline Mountain Outfitters (RMO) is a large retail company that special-\nizes in clothing and related accessories for all types of outdoor and sporting \nactivities. The mountain and western regions of the United States and Canada \nwitnessed tremendous growth in recreation activities in recent years, including \nskiing, snowboarding, mountain biking, water skiing, jet skiing, river running, \nsailing, jogging, hiking, ATVing, cycling, camping, mountain climbing, and \nrappelling. With the increased interest in outdoor sports, the market for winter \nand summer sports clothing and accessories exploded, so RMO continually ex-\npanded its line of sportswear to respond to this market.\nThe company\u2019s growth charted an interesting history of mail-order, brick-\nand-mortar, and online sales. RMO got its start by selling to clothing stores in \nthe Park City, Utah, area. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it began selling \ndirectly to customers using catalogs with mail-in and telephone-order options. It \nopened its first store in 1994. After the Winter Olympics in Park City in 2002, \nbusiness exploded and RMO quickly expanded to 10 retail outlets throughout \nthe West and added Internet sales. Last year, retail store revenue was $67 mil-\nlion, telephone- and mail-order revenues were $10 million, and Internet sales \nwere $200 million. Most sales continue to be in the West, although the market in \nseveral areas of the eastern United States and Canada is growing. By the \u00ad\nWinter \nOlympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2008, RMO\u2019s growth and profits \nresulted mainly from online sales and service, as with most specialty retailers; \nhowever, the brick-and-mortar and mail-order business remained important, \ntoo. After the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014, RMO negotiated with several \nUtah Olympic Medal Winners for endorsements. This provided additional inter-\nest throughout the West and instigated another period of rapid growth.\nFigure 1-6 shows a sample of the catalog that RMO still mails out. Although \nmail-order and telephone sales are modest, receiving the catalog encourages \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

RMO is good at anticipating trends \nand profiting from interesting vendor specials. Furthermore, its agents are al-\nways watching for new products and accessories to expand RMO\u2019s product line \nappropriately.\nAt the trade shows, RMO purchasing agents frequently find products they \nwant to add to the spring, summer, or winter apparel offering. In the past, when \nRMO purchasing agents wanted to place an order with a vendor, they would \nexchange contact information with the vendor at the trade show and would then \nfollow up via e-mails and phone calls to create a purchase order. In the current \n24/7 business climate, this business process was just too slow. RMO needed \nto speed things up to keep ahead of the competition, take advantage of vendor \ndeals at the trade shows, and be more responsive to customer demands.\nTo solve this problem, RMO initiated an information system project to \ndevelop a system for collecting and tracking information about suppliers and \nabout products added to its merchandise offerings. The Tradeshow System needs \nto take advantage of the latest in wireless devices and data capturing technology \nto allow purchasing agents to research and complete purchase orders on the spot \nat the trade shows. RMO decided to use an agile, iterative project management \napproach to get the small system completed as fast as possible with maximum \nflexibility.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Developing RMO\u2019s Tradeshow System\nWe will organize our sample project\u2014the RMO Tradeshow System\u2014into sev-\neral iterations. Our plan for the first iteration is to have it finished in just six \ndays. Our primary objective is to introduce you to the concepts and techniques \nof the six core processes. To do this, we may go a little deeper into a core process \nthan we might usually do on the first iteration of a real project. Additionally, the \niteration will appear to be managed much more formally than might be the case \nin the real world for such a small project. The second and subsequent iterations \nwill not be described in any detail, but the complete Tradeshow System project \nwill need several more iterations for a finished product.\nMost new information system applications require a project with several \niterations. In the first iteration, there are usually three major objectives. The first \nobjective is to get project approval. The second objective is to get a clear pic-\nture of the system\u2019s overall vision\u2014the overall functions and data requirements. \nThe\u00a0third objective is to determine the detail specifications and develop a solu-\ntion for one portion of the system (i.e., actually analyze, design, build, and test \none part of the system). The second and third iterations would continue to work \non the additional portions of the system based on the system vision.\nIn our project, we will touch on all these objectives within the first iteration. \nWe will show an example of a System Vision Document and then develop one \nportion of the overall system. It should be noted that the division of this project \ninto days and daily activities is somewhat arbitrary. The following organization \nis quite workable, but it is not the only way to organize the project.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Initial Project Activities\nBefore the project actually begins, the head of RMO\u2019s Purchasing Department \nworks with a systems analyst to identify and document the specific business \nneed and to define the project objectives. RMO\u2019s management then reviews the \nprimary project objectives and provides budget approval. Every organization has \nto give budget approval before a project can start. Some organizations have a \nformal process to get a project approved; other organizations have a less-formal \nprocess.

Frequently, this is done in two steps: developing a pre-\nliminary statement of benefits and then adding estimates of specific dollar costs \nand dollar benefits. Figure 1-8 is the System Vision Document for this project.\nAs described earlier, RMO needs a mobile system that can be used by its \npurchasing agents as they attend various product, clothing, and fabric trade \nshows. The system needs to fulfill two major requirements. First, it has to have \nthe functionality to capture information about suppliers and products. Second, \nit needs to be able to communicate with the home office systems, and because \nthese trade shows are held in various venues around the world, various methods \nof connectivity are needed.\nPreliminary investigation included various equipment options, like note-\nbook computers, tablets, and smartphones. Smartphones appeared to have the \nbest connection options, but their small size made viewing the details of photo-\ngraphs somewhat difficult; the iPad and other portable tablets with advanced \nconnectivity options also appear to be viable options. Because smartphones and \ntablets have similar requirements, analysts determine to develop an application \nthat will execute on either type of device, giving purchasing agents multiple op-\ntions for system access.\nToward the end of the initial project activities, a meeting is held involving \nall the key persons, including a representative of executive management. The \ndecision is made to move ahead with the project and budget the necessary funds.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Day 1 Activities\n\u275a\n\u275aRMO\u2014Tradeshow System Overall\nThe project actually begins with Day 1, which is essentially a planning day. \n\u00ad\nUsually, the project team first reviews the System Vision Document and veri-\nfies that the preliminary work is still valid. It reviews the scope of the project \nto become familiar with the problem, and then it plans the iterations and activi-\nties for the remainder of the project. The second SDLC core process\u2014Plan and \nmonitor the project\u2014includes business analysis and project management activi-\nties. These Core Process 2 activities are completed on Day 1:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDetermine the major components (functional areas) that are needed.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDefine the iterations and assign each functional area to an iteration.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDetermine team members and responsibilities.\n\u275a\n\u275aPlanning the Overall Project and the Project Iterations\nMany details need to be considered in a project plan. For our project, we will \nonly focus on the bare essentials. We will describe project planning more elabo-\nrately in later chapters. The project team meets with the users to review the \noverall business need and the objectives of the new system. The System Vision \nDocument serves as the starting point for these discussions. As is often the case, \nthe list of system capabilities provides the foundation information for determin-\ning the overall project plan. The first step is to divide the system into several sub-\nsystems or components.

Based on the list of system capabilities, the project team \nidentifies these two subsystems:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSupplier Information Subsystem\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nProduct Information Subsystem\nThe Supplier Information Subsystem will collect and maintain information \nabout the manufacturers or wholesalers and the contact people who work for \nthem. The Product Information Subsystem will capture information about the \nvarious products offered by the manufacturers or wholesalers, including de-\ntailed descriptions and photographs.\nProblem Description\nTrade shows have become an important information source for new products, new \nfashions, and new fabrics. In addition to the large providers of outdoor clothing and \nfabrics, there are many smaller providers. It is important for RMO to capture information \nabout these suppliers while the trade show is in progress. It is also important to obtain \ninformation about specific merchandise products that RMO plans to purchase. \nAdditionally, if quality photographs of the products can be obtained while at the trade \nshow, then the creation of online product pages is greatly facilitated.\nIt is recommended that a new system be developed and deployed so field purchasing\nagents can communicate more rapidly with the home office about suppliers and specific\nproducts of interest.

{"text": "14\nPART 1 \u25a0 Introduction to System Development\nThe next step is to identify the order in which the subsystems will be de-\nveloped. Many issues are considered, such as dependencies between the various \ntasks, sequential versus parallel development, project team availability, and proj-\nect urgency. In our case, the team decides that the Supplier Information \u00ad\nSubsystem \nshould be scheduled for the first iteration and the Product \u00ad\nInformation Subsys-\ntem should be scheduled for the second iteration. The third and fourth iterations \nwould complete the implementation, testing, and deployment of the system based \non what was initially implemented in the first two iterations.\n\u275a\n\u275aPlanning the Rest of the First Iteration: The Supplier Subsystem\nEach iteration is like a system development mini-project. The core processes de-\nscribed earlier can all be applied, with the scope limited to the component that \nis to be developed during the iteration. The planning process for an iteration \nconsists of these three steps:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIdentify the tasks required for the iteration.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nOrganize and sequence these tasks into a schedule.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIdentify required resources (especially people), and assign people to tasks.\nThe first step is to identify\u2014or attempt to identify\u2014all the individual tasks \nthat need to be done. As these tasks are identified, they are compiled and orga-\nnized. Sometimes, this organized list of tasks is called a work breakdown struc-\nture (WBS). Figure 1-9 shows the WBS for this iteration.\nPart of this effort is trying to estimate how long each task will take. Because \nthis iteration has a very limited scope (and only six days), all the estimates will \nbe in hours. These estimates do not include the time expended by those who are \nnot on the team. However, of those on the team, the estimates include the time \nfor the original work, the time for discussion, and the time for reviewing and \nchecking the WBS for accuracy and correctness.\nFigure 1-9 Sample handwritten \nwork breakdown structure (WBS)\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "15\nCHAPTER 1 \u25a0 From Beginning to End: An Overview of Systems Analysis and Design\nThe next step is get these tasks organized into a schedule. Again, we can be \nvery formal and use a sophisticated project scheduling tool, or we can just list \nthe tasks in the order we think they need to be done. Creating the tasks in order \nis an important part of building the schedule because it identifies any dependen-\ncies among the tasks, though many tasks can be done in parallel. For example, it \ndoes not make sense to try to design the database before we have identified the \ninformation requirements. Again, the great benefit of planning a single iteration \nis that we can make the schedule informal, and we will be able to adjust the \nwork day-by-day to respond to complexities that occur.\nFor this iteration, we have taken the tasks from the WBS and placed them on \na day-by-day sequence that we call an iteration schedule, as shown in \u00ad\nFigure\u00a01-10. \nThe project manager can use this diagram to assign people to the tasks and to put \nthe tasks on a specific schedule chart with calendar dates if necessary.\n0-1\nDevelop project plan\nDay 1: Plan\nproject\nDay 2: 12 hours\nDay 3: 14 hours\nDay 6: 12 hours\nStart\nI-1\n3 hrs\nMeet with purchasing manager\nI-2\n4 hrs\nMeet with purchasing agents\nI-3\n3 hrs\nDefine use cases\nI-5\n6 hrs\nDevelop workflows\nI-4\n2 hrs\nDefine information requirements\nII-1\n8 hrs\nDesign screens\nDay 5: 28 hours\nIV-1\n5 hrs\nPerform functional tests\nIV-2\n7 hrs\nPerform user acceptance test\nII-2\n4 hrs\nDesign and build database\nII-3\n4 hrs\nDesign overall architecture\nII-4\n6 hrs\nDesign program\ndetails\nIII-1\n14 hrs\nCode and test\nGUI layer\nIII-2\n8 hrs\nCode and test logic\nlayer\nMorning of\nDay 4: 8 hours\nFigure 1-10 Schedule for the first \niteration\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "16\nPART 1 \u25a0 Introduction to System Development\nYou should be aware that the sequence of activities and the dependencies of \nthose activities are represented in this diagram with only partial accuracy. For \nexample, we show that programming does not start until design has finished. \nHowever, in reality, there may be some overlap between the two activities.\nThe benefit of an iteration schedule is threefold. First, it helps the team or-\nganize its work so developers have enough time to think through the critical \ndesign issues before programming begins. Second, it provides a measuring rod \nto see if the iteration is on schedule. For example, if meetings with the purchas-\ning agents take all day or more than a day, the team will know early on that this \niteration will take longer than expected. Third, the project manager can see that \nprogramming may require more resources if the project is going to stay on this \nschedule. Hence, the project manager can begin lining up resources to help with \nthat part of the iteration. It should be obvious that even this simple diagram can \nhelp a project manager plan and organize the work.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Day 2 Activities\n\u275a\n\u275aThe Tradeshow System Overall\nDay 1 involved planning and organizing the project. Day 2 involves discovering \nand understanding details, which is a key part of systems analysis. Now we will \ncomplete the systems analysis activities in more detail for the complete Trade-\nshow System. These Core Process 3 activities include:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDo fact-finding tasks to understand the requirements.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDevelop a list of use cases and a use case diagram.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDevelop a list of classes and a class diagram.\n\u275a\n\u275aFact Finding and User Involvement\nBefore the project commenced, a broad definition of requirements was devel-\noped. It is now time to examine those requirements and determine exactly what \nthe user needs the system to do. There are various techniques to ensure that the \nfact finding is complete and thorough. These include interviewing the key users, \nobserving existing work processes, reviewing existing documentation and exist-\ning systems, and even researching other companies and other systems. The first \nstep is to identify the key users who will define these details. In this scenario, \nthe manager of the Purchasing Department will be one of the first users to meet \nwith. She will probably designate one or two knowledgeable purchasing agents \nwho can work with the team on an ongoing basis to develop the specifications \nand to verify that the system performs as required. All successful projects de-\npend on heavy user involvement. In Chapter 2, you will learn more about identi-\nfying key stakeholders and gathering information.\n\u275a\n\u275aIdentifying Use Cases\nIdentifying and describing use cases is the way to document what the users need \nto do with the system, hence, the term use case\u2014a case or situation where the \nsystem is used. For example, suppose a purchasing agent goes to a trade show \nand finds a new lightweight sports jacket that will work well for RMO\u2019s fall \nmerchandise offerings. Suppose that the first task the purchasing agent needs to \ndo is find out if this supplier has worked with RMO before. Thus, a use case re-\nquired for the Tradeshow System might be Look up a supplier. One good way to \nhelp you talk about use cases is to say, \u201cThe purchasing agent \u2018uses\u2019 the system \nto \u2018Look up a supplier.\u2019\u201d There are multiple methods used to identify use cases, \nwhich you will learn later in this book. Some developers prefer to use a similar \nconcept called a user story.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

When the project team meets with the purchasing agents in brainstorming \nsessions, they identify the use cases together. Because the first iteration is focus-\ning only on the Supplier Information Subsystem, the project team will also focus \nits attention on only the first four use cases on the list.\n\u275a\n\u275aIdentifying Domain Classes\nDomain classes identify those things in the real world that the system needs to \nknow about and keep track of. To find domain classes, we look for all objects, \nor things, that the system uses or captures. Objects come in all types and varia-\ntions, from tangible items (such as merchandise products that you can see and \ntouch) to more abstract concepts that you cannot touch (such as a promotion), \nwhich, though intangible, is an important thing to remember and track. Domain \nclasses are the categories of objects identified, much like a table in a database \nrepresents the category of the records it contains. A Product class represents all \nof the product objects used by the system.\nDomain classes are identified during the discussions with purchasing agents \nby looking for the nouns that describe categories of things. For example, the \nagents will often talk about suppliers, merchandise products, or inventory items. \nThese nouns become the domain classes, and each domain class has attributes \n(like contact information, product, or business location) that detail the informa-\ntion you need to store about the domain class.\nFigure 1-12 illustrates which nouns are fundamental domain classes for the \nTradeshow System. The attributes are pieces of information that help define and \ndescribe details about a domain class.\nFigure 1-11 List of use cases for \nTradeshow System\nUse Case\nDescription\nLook up supplier\nUsing supplier name, fnd supplier information and\ncontacts\nEnter/update supplier\ninformation\nEnter (new) or update (existing) supplier information\nLook up contact\nUsing contact name, fnd contact information\nEnter/update contact\ninformation\nEnter (new) or update (existing) contact information\nLook up product\ninformation\nUsing description or supplier name, look up product\ninformation\nEnter/update product\ninformation\nEnter (new) or update (existing) product information\nUpload product image\nUpload images of the merchandise product\nObject Classes\nAttributes\nSupplier\nsupplier name, address, description, comments\nContact\nname, address, phone(s), e-mail address(es),\nposition, comments\nProduct\ncategory, name, description, gender, comments\nProductPicture\nID, image\nFigure 1-12 List of domain \nclasses for Tradeshow System\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "18\nPART 1 \u25a0 Introduction to System Development\nIn addition to just providing a list of domain classes, systems analysts often \ndevelop a visual diagram of the classes, their attributes, and their associations \nwith other classes. This diagram is called a domain class diagram. Figure 1-13 \nshows the domain class diagram for the Tradeshow System.\nEach box is a class and can be thought of as a particular set of objects that \nare important to the system. Important attributes of each class are also included \nin each box. These represent the detailed information about each object that \nwill be maintained by the system. Note that some classes have lines connecting \nthem. These represent associations between the classes that need to be remem-\nbered by the system. For example, a contact is a person who works for a particu-\nlar supplier. A specific example might be that Bill Williams is the contact person \nfor the South Pacific Sportswear Company. Thus, the system needs to associate \nBill Williams and the South Pacific Sportswear Company. The association line \ndocuments that requirement.\nDomain class diagrams are a powerful and frequently used way to under-\nstand and document the information requirements of a system. The Tradeshow \nSystem is very simple, with only four classes identified\u2014two of which belong to \nthe Supplier Information Subsystem.

A use case \ndiagram is used to graphically portray the use cases and users involved in the \nsubsystem. Figure 1-14 illustrates a simple use case diagram for the Supplier \n\u00ad\nInformation Subsystem showing the four use cases as ovals and the two users as \nstick figures. The lines connecting users and use cases shows who uses the sys-\ntem for the use case: The purchasing agent carries out all four use cases, but the \nmanager also looks up suppliers or contacts.\nThe project team will look closely at the steps to follow for each use case \nto better understand how the application needs to work and to identify what \nscreens and reports will need to be developed. As the team gets more into the \ndetails, it may discover that some of the initial analysis is incomplete or not cor-\nrect and can adjust the WBS to reflect the changes. This is a good time to make \nsuch discoveries\u2014much better to find mistakes earlier than after the programs \nhave been written.\n\u275a\n\u275aDeveloping Use Case Descriptions and Workflow Diagrams\nThere are various methods for documenting the details of a use case. One that \nyou will learn later in this text is called a use case description. Another method \nis developing an activity diagram, which shows all the steps within the use case. \nThe purpose with either method is to document the interactions between the \nuser and the system (i.e., how the user interacts and uses the system to carry out \na specific work task for a single use case).\nLet us develop an activity diagram for one use case. Figure 1-15 illustrates \nthe Look up supplier use case. The flattened ovals in the diagram represent the \nactivities, the diamonds represent decision points, and the arrows represent the \nsequence of the flow. The columns designate the person who performs the ac-\ntivities, in this case the purchasing agent in the first column and the Tradeshow \nSystem in the second column. Usually, activity diagrams are quite easy for users \nto understand and critique.\nLook up supplier\nEnter/update\nsupplier\ninformation\nLook up contact\nEnter/update\ncontact\ninformation\nManager\nPurchasing\nagent\nFigure 1-14 Use case diagram for \nthe Supplier Information Subsystem\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

These situations become part of the user interface.\nIn Figure 1-15, the top arrow indicates that the supplier name is entered \ninto the system first. Thus, we infer that the use case must have an online lookup \npage with a field available to enter the supplier name. The next arrow indicates \nthe application requires a page that displays all the details for an individual sup-\nplier, including a list of existing contacts. The user may also want to see more \ndetails about a specific contact person for this supplier, so the application must \nprovide detailed information request fields for a particular contact.

The top half of the page provides the fields \nwhere the user enters supplier information, and the bottom portion of the page \nshows\u00a0the results.

{"text": "22\nPART 1 \u25a0 Introduction to System Development\nDatabase design is a fairly straightforward activity that uses the domain class \ndiagram and develops the detailed database schema that can be directly imple-\nmented by a database management system. Such elements as table design, key \nand index identification, attribute types, and other efficiency decisions are made \nduring this activity.\nDesigning the high-level system structure and the individual programs can \nbe an intricate and complex process. First, the overall structure of the system is \ndesigned by identifying the subsystems and connections to other systems. Then, \nwithin each subsystem, decisions are made about individual program modules, \nsuch as the user interface, business logic, and database access.\nIt is not uncommon for developers to begin writing program code as they \n\u00ad\ndevelop portions of the design. However, best practice suggests that the designer \ncomplete most of the high-level structure design before writing code. Consequently, \nin the RMO Tradeshow System project, we will list them as separate activities.\n\u275a\n\u275aDesigning the Database\nDesigning the database uses the information provided by the domain class dia-\ngram to determine the tables, the columns in the tables, and other components. \nSometimes, the database design is done for the entire system at once or by subsys-\ntem. At other times, it is built piecemeal\u2014use case by use case. To keep our proj-\nect simple, we will just show the database design for the two Supplier \u00ad\nInformation \nSubsystem classes. Figure 1-17 shows the two relational database tables that re-\nsult with attributes included along with data types and other properties.\n\u275a\n\u275aA General Approach to Design\nOne of the first questions encountered in software design is how and where to \nstart.

{"text": "23\nCHAPTER 1 \u25a0 From Beginning to End: An Overview of Systems Analysis and Design\nIncidentally, in the previous section, we used the class diagram as the basis \nfor the database design. Those same classes are important in developing object-\noriented program classes.\nBefore we jump more into software design, let us briefly discuss the objective \nof systems design and what we expect the output or result to be. Object-oriented \nprograms are structured as a set of interacting objects based on classes. To pro-\ngram, we need to know what the classes are, what the logic is within each class \n(i.e., the functions), and which classes must interact. This is the final objective of \nsystems design.\nWe perform this design by starting at the very highest level and then drill-\ning down to the lowest level until we have defined all the functions within each \nclass. Detailed design documents the thought process of how to program each \nuse case. For Day 4, we focus only on the overall design.\n\u275a\n\u275aDesigning the Software Components\nFigure 1-18 shows the overall structure of the new system in terms of software \ncomponents. Although the figure itself appears rather simple, some impor-\ntant decisions have been involved in the development of this design. First, note \nthat the decision was made to build this application as a browser-based sys-\ntem \u00ad\ndesigned for use on smartphones and tablets. A different and very popular \napproach would have been to build specific smartphone or tablet applications. \nBrowser-based systems sometimes do not provide the same connectivity speed \nand control as smartphone or tablet applications, but they are more versatile \nbecause they are easily deployed on different equipment, such as laptops and \ntablets, without modification, and on smartphones with only slight modifica-\ntion due to screen size.\nThese high-level design decisions will determine the detailed structure of the \nsystem. A browser-based system is structured and constructed differently than \nan application system that runs on a smartphone or a tablet computer.\n\u275a\n\u275aDefining the Preliminary Design Class Diagram\nThe Tradeshow System will be built by using object-oriented programming \n(OOP) techniques, beginning with developing the set of software classes and \nSupplier\nInformation\nsubsystem\nProduct\nInformation\nsubsystem\nBrowser\nInternet\nTradeshow System\nInternet server\nFigure 1-18 Tradeshow System \nsoftware components diagram\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Figure 1-19 is a preliminary \ndesign class diagram for the Supplier Information Subsystem that identifies \nthe software classes needed for the system (for example, the SupplierView and \nContactView classes). In Figure 1-19, we show only the problem domain de-\nsign classes and the user-interface View layer classes. Problem domain design \nclasses are usually derived from those classes that were identified during analy-\nsis activities\u2014hence, the name: problem (user need) domain design classes. You \nwill also notice that they very closely correspond to the database tables; in fact, \nin this simple project, they are almost exactly the same as the database tables.\nThe design classes in Figure 1-19 include the attributes that are needed for \nthe class.

One final element in the design class diagram is the arrows that show \nwhere a class accesses the methods of another class.\n\u275a\n\u275aDesigning Subsystem Software Architecture\nOnce we have an overall structure and approach for implementing the new sys-\ntem, we begin to drill down to the software design for the subsystem. \u00ad\nFigure\u00a01-20 \nillustrates the design of the Supplier Information Subsystem. Notice that this sub-\nsystem is further divided into layers: a View layer and a Domain layer. One of the \nadvantages of partitioning the system into layers is it is much easier to build and \nmaintain with this kind of structure given its modular format. For example, the \nsystem will be browser based, but different browsers require different techniques. \nIt is better not to get these complexities mixed in with the basic program func-\ntions.

The Domain layer includes two classes that interact with each other and \nwith the database\u2014Supplier and Contact.\n\u275a\n\u275aManaging the Project\nDesign is a complex activity with multiple perspectives\u2014from high-level struc-\ntural design to low-level detailed program design. In our project, we have sepa-\nrated the tasks for designing the overall system structure from detailed design of \nthe programs themselves. However, these activities are often done concurrently. \nThe basic high-level software architectural structure is defined first, but mid-\nlevel and low-level design are often done concurrently with programming.\nDetailed design and programming are quite time-consuming activities. \nA\u00a0project manager must decide whether to extend the project or bring on ad-\nditional programmers to help write the code. In our project, we have elected to \ninsert a half-day of free time to bring in two additional programmers and train \nthem. Of course, we could go ahead and begin Day 5\u2019s activities to ensure that \nwe keep the project on schedule.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Day 5 Activities\nAs mentioned previously, though detailed design and programming may begin \nearlier in the project, we identify it as a separate day\u2019s activity. We want to em-\nphasize that it is not a good practice to begin programming before critical in-\nformation is obtained and decisions are made.

Note that it sends a message to the Supplier \nclass requesting information when needed.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Day 6 Activities\nThe focus of Day 6 activities is final testing, a step that is required before the \nsystem is ready to be deployed. Although there are many types of testing, we \nmention only two types at this time: overall system functional testing and user \nacceptance testing. Functional testing is usually a test of all user functions and \nis often done by a quality assurance team. User acceptance tests are similar in \nnature, but these are completed by the users, who test both the correctness of \nthe system and its \u201cfitness\u201d to accomplish the business requirements.\nEach of the various testing activities in Day 6 has a similar sequence of tasks \nto perform. The tasks themselves highly depend on the test data and on the \nmethod for testing a particular test case. In some instances, the testing may be \nautomated. In others, individuals may need to manually conduct the tests.\n<?php\n    class SupplierView \n    { \n        private Supplier $theSupplier; \n        function __construct() \n        { \n            $this->theSupplier = new Supplier(); \n        } \n        function lookupSupplier()\n        { \n          include('lookupSupplier.inc.html'); \n        } \n        function displaySupplier() \n        { \n         \n  include('displaySupplierTop.inc.html'); \n       \n  extract($_REQUEST);   // get Form data    \n \n \n//Call Supplier class to retrieve the data \n            $results = $theSupplier->getSupplierInfo($supplier, $category, \n                                            $product, $country, $contact); \n           foreach ($results as $resultItem){ \n           ?> \n                   <tr> \n                       <td style=\"border:1px solid black\"> \n                             <?php echo $resultItem->supplierName?></td> \n                       <td style=\"border:1px solid black\"> \n                              <?php echo $resultItem->contactName?></td> \n                       <td style=\"border:1px solid black\"> \n                          <?php echo $resultItem->contactPosition?></td> \n                   </tr> \n            <?php } \n            include('displaySupplierFoot.inc.html'); \n        } \n    } \n?>\nFigure 1-21 Code for the \n\u00ad\nSupplierView class\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Chapter 6 provides broad and comprehensive coverage of important \nconcepts and activities of systems design. It serves not only as a broad overview \nof design principles, but also as a foundation for later chapters that explain the \ndetailed techniques, tasks, skills, and models used to carry out design.\nChapter 7 covers key aspects of architectural design. System interfaces oc-\ncur when one information system communicates or interacts with another in-\nformation system without human intervention. System interfaces are becoming \nincreasingly important because of Web services and cloud computing. Other re-\nlated concepts, such as controls and security, are also presented in this chapter.\nChapter 8 presents design principles related to the user. Designing the user \ninterface requires a combination of analysis and design. It is related to analysis \nbecause it requires heavy user involvement and includes specifying user activities \nand desires. On the other hand, it is a design activity because it specifies final \ncomponents that are used to drive the programming effort. The pages, forms, \nreports, and other user interaction components must be precisely designed so \nthey can be programmed as part of the final system.\nChapter 9 explains how to design the database from the information gleaned \nduring analysis and the identification of the domain classes.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Part 4: Projects and Project Management\nBy this point, you will have a basic understanding of all the elements of system \ndevelopment.\nPart 4 uses these concepts to explain the process of organizing and manag-\ning development projects.

The \nproject is divided into days, as was our Tradeshow \nSystem project. The daily assignments for this case \nshould be considered as preliminary efforts and rough \ndrafts. The objective of these assignments is to help \nyou remember the overall approach to software devel-\nopment. Several assignments have been listed for each \nday to allow your instructor to select those that best \nmeet the objectives of the course.\nDay 0: Define the Vision\nEither by yourself or with another class member, \nbrainstorm all the functions this geocaching system \nmight do. Keep it at a very high level. These activities \nclosely relate to Core Process 1: Identify problem and \nobtain approval.\nAssignment D0-1: Write a rough draft of the \n\u00ad\nSystem Vision Document based on your brain-\nstorming ideas. [Hint: Think of what Wayne wants \nthe system to do and why this helps him.]\nDay 1: Plan the Project\nBased on the scope and vision you described in the \n\u00ad\nSystem Vision Document, divide the project into at \nleast two separate subsystems that can be done in sepa-\nrate iterations. For example, perhaps a first version can \nrun on a laptop, with a second version that includes \nmobile components for a smartphone. These activities \nare related to Core Process 2: Plan and monitor the \n\u00ad\nproject\u2014what to do, how to do it, and who does it.\nAssignment D1-1: Divide the system into at least \ntwo separate components or subsystems, which \ncan be supported with two iterations. Briefly de-\nscribe each.\nAssignment D1-2: Create a work breakdown \nstructure that lists all the steps to complete the \nfirst iteration. Put a time estimate on each step. \n[Hint: Use the one in this chapter as a model.]\nDay 2: Define and Understand the \nRequirements\nOn Day 2, you want to get an overall view of what \nthe system needs to do for Wayne. There are two pri-\nmary areas to focus on to obtain this high-level un-\nderstanding of the system: a list of use cases and a list \nof domain classes. You could document this informa-\ntion in lists, but diagrams provide a visual representa-\ntion that is often easier to remember and understand. \nThese activities support Core Process 3: Discover and \nunderstand details.\nAssignment D2-1: Identify a few use cases that \napply to one subsystem. [Hint: Think of what \nWayne plans to do with the system. He will use \nthe system to \u201cdo what\u201d?]\nAssignment D2-2: Try to identify the classes that \napply to the first project iteration. [Hint: Think of \n\u201cinformation things\u201d that Wayne wants the sys-\ntem to \u201cremember.\u201d]\nAssignment D2-3: Create a simple use case dia-\ngram from the list of use cases. [Hint: Drawing \nby hand is fine. Use the one in this chapter as a \nmodel.]\nAssignment D2-4: Create a simple class diagram \nfrom the list of classes. [Hint: Drawing by hand is \nfine. Use the one in this chapter as a model. Think \nof other information that applies to each class.]\nDay 3: Define the User Experience\nThese activities are a continuation of what you be-\ngan in Day 2. The objective here is to further define \nwhat Wayne will need and how he will actually use \nthe system. You will determine exactly how each use \ncase works\u2014what steps and options are available \nwith the use case and even what the display and data-\nentry screens will look like. These activities primar-\nily support Core Process 3: Discover and understand \ndetails.\nAssignment D3-1: Select a single use case and \nidentify the steps required to perform the use \ncase. [Hint: Think of what Wayne does and how \nthe system responds.]\nAssignment D3-2: Make a workflow diagram of \nthe selected use case. [Hint: Drawing by hand is \nfine. Each step from D3-1 goes in an oval. \u00ad\nConnect \nthe ovals with arrows.]\nAssignment D3-3: Sketch out one of the screens \nthat will be required to support a use case. The \nscreen should allow for data entry and display of \ninformation. [Hint: Don\u2019t make it elaborate. Focus \nonly on the input and output data fields that apply \nto only one use case.]\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Development of that system followed the \nsix core processes of the SDLC. The information system application envisioned \nfor Mountain Vista Motorcycles is another situation where the six core processes \nof the SDLC would be required, but because there is much uncertainty about \nwhat the virtual community would actually involve, the project would have to \nbe highly agile. Some of the early iterations would need to focus intensely on \ndiscovering and understanding the details of the problem and less on planning \nthe project up front. In this respect, each project adapts the SDLC to its specific \nneeds. Nevertheless, the same six core processes are always required:\n1.\t Identify the problem or need and obtain approval to proceed.\n2.\t Plan and monitor the project\u2014what to do, how to do it, and who does it.\n38\nOpening case\u2002 Mountain Vista Motorcycles\nAmanda Lamy, president and majority stockholder of \nMountain Vista Motorcycles (MVM), is an avid motor-\ncycle enthusiast and businesswoman. MVM is head-\nquartered in Denver and has locations throughout \nthe western United States and Canada. Since the late \n1990s, the market for motorcycles has grown tremen-\ndously. Amanda expects that the market will continue to \nbe strong throughout the 2010s.\nThe demographics of the motorcycle market are \nan interesting study in contrasts\u2014an over-50 majority \ncustomer base, but with an under-30 contingent that is \ngrowing. The remaining customer base includes men \nand women between the ages of 30 and 50.\nThe \u201cover 50\u201d customers are typically male profes-\nsionals or businesspeople who are partly or fully retired. \nThey have substantial disposable income, lots of free \ntime, and tend to own multiple expensive motorcycles \nfrom such manufacturers as Harley-Davidson, Honda, \nDucati, and Moto Guzi. Older customers are generally \ncomfortable with Internet and Web technology, but are \nnot significant users of social media technology. Al-\nthough many own smartphones, they tend to use them \nprimarily for voice, e-mail, and texting.\nMale customers under 30 years of age tend to buy \nsport and dirt bikes, typically from such manufacturers \nas Suzuki and Kawasaki. They buy less-expensive bikes \nthan older customers and are more likely to buy parts \nand supplies from MVM to service their own bikes. Fe-\nmale customers under 30 years of age tend to buy motor \nscooters and smaller \u201ccommuter\u201d motorcycles. Cus-\ntomers in the 30\u201350 age range include men and women \nwho buy bikes of many types from many manufacturers. \nFor all customers under the age of 50, comfort with and \nuse of Internet technology, social media, and portable \ncomputing devices such as smartphones and iPads is \nvery high, but especially with customers under age 30.\nAmanda is convinced that the key to long-term suc-\ncess in the motorcycle market is to build an active com-\nmunity of motorcycle enthusiasts that includes a broad \nspectrum of customers at each MVM location. In es-\nsence, each location needs to be seen as a hub of local \nmotorcycle-related activity and information in physical and \nvirtual terms. On the physical side, MVM has added activ-\nity and event-oriented pages to its Web sites, sponsored \nrallies and clubs, added meeting rooms and small coffee \nshops in some locations, and collocated with bars and res-\ntaurants that feature motorcycle-related themes and en-\ntertainment. These efforts have yielded good results with \nolder customers but less so with younger customers.\nAmanda is concerned about the lack of participation \nin the new initiatives by younger customers and is sure \nthat MVM\u2019s minimal presence in social media and virtual \nrelationships is a significant factor. She and her senior \nstaff, most of whom are older, are unsure how to attract \nyounger customers. They have little knowledge of and no \nexperience with creating modern technology-based virtual \ncommunities. To fill this gap, Amanda turns to her chief \ninformation officer (CIO), and tasks her with finding a way \ntechnology can connect the diverse customer base.\nMVM\u2019s CIO is starting to develop a project plan for a \nvirtual community oriented toward younger customers. \nIf the plan were for developing a traditional information \nsystem, she would use such standard approaches as in-\nterviewing internal users and managers, and having her \ndevelopment staff write specifications, generate story-\nboards and screen layouts, and develop prototypes. But \nfew of the intended virtual community users are MVM \nemployees, and few staff members fully comprehend \nhow to successfully use social media and other tech-\nniques for building virtual societies. Traditional methods \nof defining and refining requirements seem inadequate \nto the task.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The extra \ndepth and detail are needed to tackle larger and more complex projects. This \nchapter concentrates on systems analysis activities (Core Process 3), and the next \nfew chapters follow up with detailed discussions of models developed during \nthose systems analysis activities. Subsequent chapters expand the discussion of \nother core SDLC processes. The RMO Consolidated Sales and Marketing Sys-\ntem project is used for examples throughout the rest of the book. It is a much \nlarger project than the Tradeshow System project in Chapter 1.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The RMO Consolidated Sales \nand\u00a0Marketing\u00a0System Project\nRidgeline Mountain Outfitters has an elaborate set of information systems \napplications developed over the years to support operations and management. \nHowever, there is a growing gap between customer expectations, current techno-\nlogical capabilities, and existing RMO systems that support sales and customer \ninteraction. This section reviews the existing system inventory and introduces \nthe proposed Consolidated Sales and Marketing System that will update and \nenhance sales and marketing.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Existing RMO Information Systems and Architecture\nRMO\u2019s Information Systems Department has always been forward looking. In \npast years, the department, in conjunction with corporate strategic plans, has \ndeveloped five-year plans for development and deployment of new technology \nand information systems. The planning process has been an excellent tool to \nhelp the organization stay current with new trends and technology capabilities. \nHowever, the plans themselves have had mixed success. One of the problems \nwith long-range information technology (IT) and software development plans is \nthat technology changes rapidly and moves in unexpected directions. For exam-\nple, the Tradeshow System described in Chapter 1 was made possible by the \navailability of powerful and flexible handheld devices and the widespread avail-\nability of Wi-Fi and Internet connections. Both technologies reached a fairly \nmature level in just a couple of years, which created an opportunity for RMO to \noptimize this important business process for mobile technology.\nHistorically, RMO has adopted new technology as soon as it became cost \neffective. Past examples include adoption of smaller servers and desktop comput-\ning, interconnection of locations with dedicated telecommunications links, and \nsuch Web-based technologies as customer-oriented Web sites and browser-based \nuser interfaces for internal systems. At present, RMO has a disparate collection of \ncomputers dispersed across home offices, retail stores, telephone centers, order ful-\nfillment/shipping centers, and warehouses\u2014everything connected by a complex \nset of local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and virtual pri-\nvate networks (VPNs). This constitutes RMO\u2019s current technology architecture.\nThe term technology architecture refers to the set of computing hard-\nware, network hardware and topology, and system software\u2014such as operat-\ning and database management systems\u2014employed by an organization. RMO\u2019s \ntechnology architecture is modern but not state of the art, which is consistent \nwith its goal of adopting proven technology.\ntechnology architecture\u2003 a set of comput-\ning hardware, network hardware and topol-\nogy, and system software employed by an \norganization\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "40\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nThe term application architecture refers to the set of information systems \n(the software applications) the organization needs to support its strategic plan. \nEach information system supports the work that needs to be carried out by the \norganization; the strategic plan includes what the information systems are and \nhow the information systems are integrated together.\nCurrently, the major systems in RMO\u2019s application architecture consist of \nthe following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSupply chain management (SCM). This application was deployed five years \nago as a client/server application using Java and Oracle. Currently, it sup-\nports inventory control, purchasing, and distribution, although integration \nof functions needs improvement. The new Tradeshow System will interface \nwith this system.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPhone/mail order system. This modest client/server application was devel-\noped 12 years ago using Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL Server as a quick \nsolution to customer demand for phone and mail orders. It is integrated \nwith the SCM and has reached capacity.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nRetail Store System (RSS). This is a retail store package with point-of-sale \nprocessing. It was upgraded eight years ago from overnight batch to real-\ntime inventory updates to/from the SCM.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCustomer Support System (CSS). This system was first deployed 15 years ago \nas a Web-based catalog to support customer mail and phone orders. Four \nyears later, it was upgraded to an Internet storefront, supporting customer \ninquiries, shopping cart, order tracking, shipping, back orders, and returns.\nAll organizations\u2014including RMO\u2014face a difficult challenge keeping all \ntheir information systems current and effective. Because development resources \nare limited, an organization\u2019s technology architecture and application architec-\nture will include a mix of old and new. Older systems were often designed for \noutdated operational methods and typically lack modern technologies and fea-\ntures that some competitors have adopted to improve efficiency or competitive-\nness. Such is the case with RMO\u2019s existing customer-facing systems, which have \nseveral shortcomings, including:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nTreating phone, Web, and retail sales as separate systems rather than as an \nintegrated whole\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEmploying outdated Web-based storefront technology\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nNot supporting modern technologies and customer interaction modes, \nincluding mobile computing devices and social networking\nRather than incrementally update the existing sales systems, RMO plans to \nreplace them with the new Consolidated Sales and Marketing System, as shown \nin Figure 2-1.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The New Consolidated Sales and Marketing System\nThe goals of the Consolidated Sales and Marketing System (CSMS) are to mod-\nernize the technology and functionality of the CSS and to add more customer-\noriented functionality. On the technology side, the CSMS will incorporate \ncurrent Web standards and require high-bandwidth customer Internet connec-\ntions and high-resolution displays. Updating the technology allows a higher \ndegree of interactivity, richer graphics, and a streamlined interface.\nKey additions to system functionality will be support for mobile comput-\ning devices, incorporation of customer feedback and comments into product \ninformation, and integration of social networking functions. Unlike the CSS, \nthe CSMS will support smartphones and tablet computers with interfaces \nspecifically designed for each platform and with downloadable apps. Cus-\ntomer\u00a0feedback will be captured directly through the Internet storefront, from \napplication architecture\u2003 the set of \ninformation systems (the software applica-\ntions) the organization needs to support its \nstrategic plan\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The system will keep track of \ndetailed shipping addresses, including payment information and preferences. \nRMO also instituted a Mountain Bucks program where customers accumu-\nlate credits that can be used to redeem prizes as well as purchase merchandise. \nCustomers may use these Mountain Bucks for themselves or they may transfer \nthem to other people in their family/friends group. This is a great opportunity \nto combine accumulated bucks to obtain expensive merchandise.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nThe Marketing subsystem is primarily for employees to set up the infor-\nmation and services for customers. Additionally, employees can enter \ninformation about the merchandise offered by RMO. This subsystem is also \nfed by\u00a0the SCM system to maintain accurate data on the inventory in stock \nand anticipated arrival dates of items on order. Employees also set up the \nvarious promotional packages and seasonal catalogs by using the functions \nof this subsystem. Furthermore, RMO is experimenting with a new idea to \nenhance customer experience and satisfaction: building partner relation-\nships with other retailers so customers can earn \u201ccombined\u201d points with \nRMO purchases or a partner retailer purchase. These points can be used at \nRMO or transferred and used at the partner. For example, because RMO \nsells outdoor and sporting clothing, it has partnered with various sporting \ngoods stores. That way, a person can buy sporting equipment at the sport-\ning equipment store and get promotional discounts for clothing at RMO. \nThe success of this new venture has yet to be proven, but RMO anticipates \nthat it will enhance the shopping experience of all its customers.\nIn later chapters, more details will be given about the capabilities of the new \nCSMS system.

{"text": "43\nCHAPTER 2 \u25a0 Investigating System Requirements\nBy completing these activities, the analyst defines in great detail what the \ninformation system needs to accomplish to provide the organization with the \ndesired benefits.\nAlthough we concentrate only on analysis activities in this chapter, keep in \nmind that they are usually intermixed with design, implementation, and other \nactivities during the system development life cycle. For example, as shown in \nFigure 2-2, analysis activities are most intensive in the second iteration but occur \nin varying degrees during all project iterations except the last. This pattern is \ntypical because an analyst often concentrates on one part of a system, defining \nrequirements only for that part and simultaneously designing and implement-\ning software to satisfy those requirements. Organizing development activities in \nthis iterative manner enables development to be broken into smaller steps and \nhelps users to validate requirements by testing and observing parts of the func-\ntional system. The following sections briefly describe analysis activities, and the \nremainder of this chapter expands the discussion of information gathering and \ndefining system requirements.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Gather Detailed Information\nSystems analysts obtain information from people who will be using the system, \neither by interviewing them or by watching them work. In short, analysts need to \ntalk to nearly everyone who will use the new system or has used similar systems, \nand they must read nearly everything available about the existing system. Spe-\ncifically, they obtain additional information by reviewing planning documents \nand policy statements; study existing systems, including their documentation; \nand obtain additional information by looking at what other companies (particu-\nlarly vendors) have done when faced with a similar business need. Finally, they \ntry to understand an existing system by identifying and understanding activities \nof all the current and future users by identifying all present and future locations \nwhere work occurs and all system interfaces with other systems, both inside and \noutside the organization. Later in this chapter, we discuss how to identify and \nextract information from all these people.\nBeginning analysts often underestimate how much there is to learn about the \nwork the user performs. The analyst must become an expert in the business area \nthe system will support. For example, if you are implementing an order-entry \nsystem, you need to become an expert on the way orders are processed (includ-\ning related accounting procedures). If you are implementing a loan-processing \nsystem, you need to become an expert on the rules used for approving credit. If \nyou work for a bank, you need to think of yourself as a banker. The most suc-\ncessful analysts become experts in their organization\u2019s main business.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Define Requirements\nThe analyst uses information gathered from users and documents to define \nrequirements for the new system. System requirements include the functions the \nsystem must perform (functional requirements) and such related issues as user-\ninterface formats and requirements for reliability, performance, and security \n(nonfunctional requirements). We further discuss the distinction between func-\ntional and nonfunctional requirements a bit later in this chapter.\nDefining requirements is not just a matter of writing down facts and figures. \nInstead, the analyst creates models to record requirements, reviews the mod-\nels with users and others, and refines and expands the models to reflect new \nor updated information. In Chapter 1, you learned about requirements models, \nsuch as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and domain model class diagrams. \nBuilding and refining requirements models occupies much of the analyst\u2019s time. \nThis chapter and the next two chapters explain in considerable depth how to \ncreate requirements models.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "44\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Prioritize Requirements\nOnce the system requirements are well understood, it is important to establish \nwhich requirements are most crucial for the system. Sometimes, users request \nadditional system functions that are desirable but not essential. However, users \nand analysts need to ask themselves which functions are truly important and \nwhich are fairly important but not absolutely required. Again, an analyst who \nunderstands the organization and the work done by the users will have more \ninsight toward answering these questions.\nWhy prioritize the functions requested by the users? Resources are always \nlimited, and the analyst must always be prepared to justify the scope of the sys-\ntem. Therefore, it is important to know what is absolutely required. Unless the \nanalyst carefully evaluates priorities, system requirements tend to expand as \nusers make more suggestions (a phenomenon called scope creep). Requirements \npriorities also help to determine the number, composition, and ordering of proj-\nect iterations. High-priority requirements are often incorporated into early proj-\nect iterations so analysts and users have ample opportunity to refine those parts \nof the system. Furthermore, a project with many high-priority requirements will \ntypically have many iterations.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Develop User-Interface Dialogs\nIn some cases, when a new system is replacing an old system that does similar \nwork, users are usually quite sure about their requirements and the desired form \nof the user interface. In other cases, the system development project breaks new \nground by automating functions that were previously performed manually or by \nimplementing functions that were not performed in the past. In either case, users \ntend to be uncertain of many aspects of system requirements. Such requirements \nmodels as use cases, activity diagrams, and interaction diagrams can be devel-\noped based on user input, but it is often difficult for users to interpret and vali-\ndate such abstract models.\nIn comparison, user validation of a user interface is much simpler and more \nreliable because the user can see and feel the system. To most users, the user \ninterface is all that matters. Thus, developing user-interface dialogs is a powerful \nmethod of eliciting and documenting requirements. Analysts can develop user \ninterfaces via abstract models, such as interaction diagrams and written dialogs \n(covered in more detail in later chapters), or they can develop storyboards or \nuser-interface prototypes on the actual input/output devices that users will use \n(e.g., a computer monitor, iPad, or smartphone). A prototype interface can serve \nas a requirement and a starting point for developing a portion of the system. \nA\u00a0user-interface prototype developed in an early iteration can be expanded in \nlater iterations to become a fully functioning part of the system.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Evaluate Requirements with Users\nIdeally, evaluating requirements with users and documenting the requirements are \nfully integrated. But in practice, users generally have other responsibilities besides \ndeveloping a new system. Thus, analysts usually use an iterative process in which \nthey elicit user input to model requirements, return to the user for additional input \nor validation, and then work alone to incorporate the new input and refine the \nmodels. Prototypes of user interfaces and other parts of the system may also be \ndeveloped when \u201cpaper\u201d models are inadequate or when users and analysts need \nto prove that chosen technologies will do what they are supposed to do. Also, if \nthe system will include new or innovative technology, the users may need help \nvisualizing the possibilities available from the new technology as they define what \nthey require. Prototypes can fill that need. The processes of eliciting requirements, \nbuilding models and prototypes, and evaluating them with users may repeat many \ntimes until requirements models and prototypes are complete and accurate.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Most of the analyst\u2019s time \nis devoted to requirements: gathering information about them, formalizing them \nby using models and prototypes, refining and expanding them, prioritizing them, \nand generating and evaluating alternatives. But to fully understand those activi-\nties, you need to answer a fundamental question: What are requirements?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0System Requirements and FURPS\nSystem requirements are all the activities the new system must perform or \nsupport and the constraints that the new system must meet. Generally, analysts \ndivide system requirements into two categories: functional and nonfunctional \nrequirements. Functional requirements are the activities that the system must \nperform (i.e., the business uses to which the system will be applied). For example, \nif you are developing a payroll system, the required business uses might include \nsuch functions as \u201cgenerate electronic fund transfers,\u201d \u201ccalculate commission \namounts,\u201d \u201ccalculate payroll taxes,\u201d \u201cmaintain employee-dependent informa-\ntion,\u201d and \u201creport tax deductions to the IRS.\u201d The new system must handle all \nthese functions. Identifying and describing all these business uses require a sub-\nstantial amount of time and effort because the list of functions and their depen-\ndencies can be very complex.\nIn Chapter 1, the functional requirements were defined by the list of use \ncases for the Tradeshow System, but functional requirements are also based on \nthe procedures and rules that an organization uses to run its business. That is \nwhy use case details must be captured and modeled, too. Sometimes, they are \nwell documented and easy to identify and describe. An example might be the \nfollowing: \u201cAll new employees must fill out a W-4 form to enter information \nabout their tax withholding in the payroll system.\u201d Other business rules might \nbe more obtuse or difficult to find. An example from RMO might be the fol-\nlowing: \u201cAir shipping charges are reduced by 50 percent for orders over $200 \nthat weigh less than two pounds.\u201d Discovering such rules is critical to the final \ndesign of the system. If this rule were not discovered, customers who had relied \non it in the past might become angry. Modifying the system after customers start \ncomplaining is much more difficult and expensive than building in the rule from \nthe start.\nNonfunctional requirements are characteristics of the system other than \nthose activities it must perform or support. It is not always easy to distinguish \nfunctional from nonfunctional requirements. One way to do so is to use a frame-\nwork for identifying and classifying requirements. There have been many such \nframeworks developed over time; the most widely used today is referred to as \nFURPS (see Figure 2-3). FURPS is an acronym that stands for functional, \nusability, reliability, performance, and security. The F in FURPS is equivalent to \nthe functional requirements defined previously. The remaining categories (URPS) \ndescribe nonfunctional requirements as follows:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nusability requirements describe operational characteristics related to \nusers, such as the user interface, related work procedures, online help, \nand documentation. For example, the user interface for a smartphone app \nshould behave similarly to other apps when responding to such gestures as \ntwo-finger slides, pinching, and expanding. Additional requirements might \ninclude menu format, color schemes, use of the organization\u2019s logo, and \nmultilanguage support.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReliability requirements describe the dependability of a system\u2014how \noften a system exhibits such behaviors as service outages and incorrect pro-\ncessing and how it detects and recovers from those problems.\nSystem requirements\u2003 all the activities \nthe new system must perform or support and \nthe constraints that the new system must \nmeet (functional + nonfunctional)\nFunctional requirements\u2003 the activities \nthe system must perform to support the \nusers\u2019 work\nnonfunctional requirements\u2003 required \nsystem characteristics other than the activi-\nties it must perform or support\nFURPS\u2003 an acronym that stands for func-\ntional, usability, reliability, performance, and \nsecurity requirements\nusability requirements\u2003 the requirements \nfor operational characteristics related to \nusers, such as the user interface, related work \nprocedures, online help, and documentation\nreliability requirements\u2003 the require-\nments that describe system dependability\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "46\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPerformance requirements describe operational characteristics related \nto measures of workload, such as throughput and response time. For exam-\nple, the client portion of a system might be required to have a .5 second \nresponse time to all button presses, and the server might need to support \n100 simultaneous client sessions (with the same response time).\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSecurity requirements describe how access to the application will be \ncontrolled and how data will be protected during storage and transmission. \nFor example, the application might be password protected, encrypt locally \nstored data with 1024-bit keys, and use secure HTTP for communication \namong client and server nodes.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Additional Requirements Categories\nFURPS+  is an extension of FURPS that adds additional categories, including \ndesign constraints as well as implementation, system interface, physical, and \nsupportability requirements\u2014all these additional categories summarized by the \nplus sign. Here are short descriptions of each category:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDesign constraints describe restrictions to which the hardware and soft-\nware must adhere. For example, a cell phone application might be required \nto use the Android operating system, consume no more than 30 MB of \nflash memory storage, consume no more than 10 MB of system memory \nwhile running, and operate on CPUs rated at 1 GHz or higher.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nImplementation requirements describe constraints such as required pro-\ngramming languages and tools, documentation method and level of detail, \nand a specific communication protocol for distributed components.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nInterface requirements describe interactions among systems. For example, \na financial reporting system for a publicly traded company in the United \nStates must generate data for the Securities and Exchange Commis-\nsion (SEC) in a specific XML format. The system might also supply data \ndirectly to stock exchanges and bond rating agencies, and automatically \ngenerate Twitter messages, RSS feeds, and Facebook updates.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPhysical requirements describe such characteristics of hardware as size, \nweight, power consumption, and operating conditions. For example, a system \nthat supports battlefield communications might have such requirements as \nweighing less than 200 grams, being no larger than 5 centimeters cubed, and \noperating for 48 hours on a fully charged 1200 milliwatt lithium ion\u00a0battery.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSupportability requirements describe how a system is installed, configured, moni-\ntored, and updated. For example, requirements for a game installed on a home \nPC might include automatic configuration to maximize performance on existing \nhardware, error reporting, and download of updates from a support server.\nAs with any set of requirements categories, FURPS+ has some gray areas \nand some overlaps among its categories. For example, is a requirement that a \nbattlefield communications device survive immersion in water and operate across \na temperature range of \u201320\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C a performance or physical requirement? \nUser interface, ease of use\nFailure rate, recovery methods\nResponse time, throughput\nAccess controls, encryption\nFunctional\nRequirement\ncategories\nFURPS +\ncategories\nNonfunctional\nUsability\nReliability\nPerformance\nSecurity\nFunctions\nBusiness rules and processes\nExample\nrequirements\nFigure 2-3 FURPS acronym \nfor functional, usability, reliabil-\nity, performance, and security \nrequirements\nperformance requirements\u2003 the require-\nments that describe operational characteris-\ntics related to measures of workload, such as \nthroughput and response time\nsecurity requirements\u2003 the requirements \nthat describe how access to the application \nwill be controlled and how data will be pro-\ntected during storage and transmission\nFURPS+\u2003 an extension of FURPS that \nincludes design constraints as well as imple-\nmentation, system interface, physical, and \nsupportability requirements\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "47\nCHAPTER 2 \u25a0 Investigating System Requirements\nIs a restriction to use no more than 100 megabytes of memory a performance or \ndesign requirement? Is a requirement to secure communication between work-\nstations and servers with 1024-bit encryption a performance, design, or imple-\nmentation requirement? What is important is that all requirements be identified \nand precisely stated early in the development process and that inconsistencies or \ntrade-offs among them be resolved.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Stakeholders\nStakeholders are your primary source of information for system requirements. \nStakeholders are all the people who have an interest in the successful imple-\nmentation of the system. Depending on the nature and scope of the system, this \ncan be a small group, or a large, diverse group. For example, when implement-\ning a comprehensive accounting system for a publicly traded corporation in the \nUnited States, the stakeholders include bookkeepers, accountants, managers and \nexecutives, customers, suppliers, auditors, investors, the SEC, and the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS). Each stakeholder group interacts with the system in dif-\nferent ways, and each has a unique perspective on system requirements. Before \ngathering detailed information, the analyst identifies every type of stakeholder \nwho has an interest in the new system and ensures that critical people from each \nstakeholder category are available to serve as the business experts.\nOne useful way to help identify all the interested stakeholders is to con-\nsider two dimensions by which they vary: internal stakeholders versus exter-\nnal stakeholders and operational stakeholders versus executive stakeholders \n(see Figure\u00a02-4). Internal stakeholders are those within the organization \nwho interact with the system or have a significant interest in its operation or \nsuccess. You may be tempted to define internal stakeholders as employees of \nan organization, but some organizations\u2014such as nonprofits and educational \ninstitutions\u2014have internal users (e.g., volunteers and students) who are not \nemployees. External stakeholders are those outside the organization\u2019s control \nand influence\u2014although this distinction can also be fuzzy, such as when an \norganization\u2019s strategic partners (e.g., suppliers and shipping companies) interact \ndirectly with internal systems.\nOperational stakeholders are those who regularly interact with a system in \nthe course of their jobs or lives. Examples include accountants interacting with \nan accounting or billing system, factory supervisors interacting with a production \nscheduling system, customers interacting with an Internet storefront, and patients \nRegulators\nPartner organizations\nBookkeepers\nOperational\nExecutive\nAccountants\nInternal auditors\nInternal\nExternal\nCustomers\nInvestors\nBoard of directors\nSenior managers\nExternal \nauditors\nOperational\nmanagers\nFigure 2-4 Stakeholders of a \ncomprehensive accounting system \nfor a publicly traded company\ninternal stakeholders\u2003 persons within the \norganization who interact with the system or \nhave a significant interest in its operation or \nsuccess\nexternal stakeholders\u2003 persons outside \nthe organization\u2019s control and influence who \ninteract with the system or have a significant \ninterest in its operation or success\noperational stakeholders\u2003 persons who \nregularly interact with a system in the course \nof their jobs or lives\nStakeholders\u2003 persons who have an \n\u00ad\ninterest in the successful implementation of \nthe system\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Executive stakeholders are \nthose who do not interact directly with the system, but who either use informa-\ntion produced by the system or have a significant financial or other interest in its \noperation and success. Examples include an organization\u2019s senior managers and \nboard of directors, regulatory agencies, and taxing authorities.\nIncluding such stakeholders in analysis activities is critical because the infor-\nmation they possess may not be obvious or widely known in the organization. \nIn addition, system requirements imposed by executive stakeholders, especially \nexternal ones, often have significant legal and financial implications. For exam-\nple, consider the potential effects of IRS regulations on an accounting system, or \nthe effects of federal and state privacy laws on a social networking system.\nTwo other stakeholder groups that do not neatly fall into the categories just \ndescribed deserve special attention. The client is the person or group that pro-\nvides the funding for the project. In many cases, the client is senior management. \nHowever, clients may also be a separate group, such as a corporation\u2019s board of \ndirectors, executives in a parent company, or the board of regents of a university. \nThe project team includes the client in its list of important stakeholders because \nthe team must provide periodic status reviews to the client throughout develop-\nment. The client or a direct representative on a steering or oversight committee \nalso usually approves stages of the project and releases funds.\nAn organization\u2019s technical and support staff are also stakeholders in any sys-\ntem. The technical staff includes people who establish and maintain the computing \nenvironment of the organization. Support staff provide user training, troubleshoot-\ning, and related services. Both groups should provide guidance in such areas as pro-\ngramming language, computer platforms, network interfaces, and existing systems \nand their support issues. Any new system must fit within an organization\u2019s existing \ntechnology architecture, application architecture, and support environment. Thus, \ntechnical and support representatives are important stakeholders.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The Stakeholders for RMO\nAs a starting point for identifying CSMS stakeholders, it is helpful to develop a \nlist of current CSS stakeholders, which include:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPhone/mail sales order representatives\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWarehouse and shipping personnel\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMarketing personnel who maintain online catalog information\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMarketing, sales, accounting, and financial managers\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSenior executives\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCustomers\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nExternal shippers (e.g., UPS and FedEx)\nBecause the CSMS will take over existing functions of the CSS, the list of CSMS \nstakeholders includes all the stakeholders in the CSS list; however, there are some \nsubtle differences. For example, the inclusion of social networking functions in the \nCSMS and the planned ability to share Mountain Bucks expands the definition of \na customer. Whereas the old CSS was intended for use by potential customers visit-\ning the Web site, the new system will interact with a much larger group of external \nstakeholders, including friends and family of existing customers and potentially all \nusers of popular social networking sites. In essence, the stakeholder group \u201cCus-\ntomers\u201d is much larger, more diverse, and includes people who have not purchased \nfrom RMO. Ensuring that the viewpoints and requirements of this diverse group \nare represented during analysis activities will be a considerable challenge.\nExpanded functionality for sales promotions with partner organizations cre-\nates an entirely new group of external stakeholders within those partner organi-\nzations. At this point, it is unclear whether that group will include operational \nexecutive stakeholders\u2003 persons who \ndon\u2019t interact directly with the system but \nwho either use information produced by the \nsystem or have a significant financial or other \ninterest in its operation and success\nclient\u2003 a person or group that provides the \nfunding for the system development project\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

RMO often uses these standard information-gathering techniques:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nInterviewing users and other stakeholders\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDistributing and collecting questionnaires\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReviewing inputs, outputs, and documentation\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nObserving and documenting business procedures\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nResearching vendor solutions\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCollecting active user comments and suggestions\nAll these methods have proven to be effective, although some are more effi-\ncient than others. In most cases, analysts combine methods to increase their effec-\ntiveness and efficiency and to provide a comprehensive fact-finding approach.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Interview Users and Other Stakeholders\nInterviewing users and other stakeholders is an effective way to understand \nbusiness functions and business rules. Unfortunately, it is also the most time-\nconsuming and resource-expensive option. In this method, systems analysts do \nthe following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPrepare detailed questions\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMeet with individuals or groups of users\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nObtain and discuss answers to the questions\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDocument the answers\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFollow up as needed in future meetings or interviews\nObviously, this process may take some time, so it usually requires multiple \nsessions with each of the users or user groups.\n\u275a\n\u275aQuestion Themes\nWhether in informal meetings, formal interviews, or as part of a questionnaire \nor survey, analysts ask questions. But which questions should analysts ask? \n\u00ad\nFigure 2-6 shows three major themes that guide the analysts when they are ask-\ning questions to define system requirements; it also shows sample questions that \narise from those themes.\nWhat Are the Business Processes?\u2003 The analyst must obtain a comprehensive list \nof all the business processes. In most cases, the users provide answers in terms \nof the current system, so the analyst must carefully discern which of those func-\ntions are fundamental and which may possibly be eliminated with an improved \nsystem. For example, salesclerks might indicate that the first task they perform \nwhen a customer places an order is to check the customer\u2019s credit history. In the \nnew system, salesclerks might never need to perform that function; the system \nmight perform the check automatically. The function remains a system require-\nment, but the method of carrying out the function and its timing is changed.\nTheme\nQuestions to users \nWhat are the business operations and processes?\nWhat do you do?\nWhat information is needed to perform those\noperations?\nHow should those operations be performed? \nHow do you do it?\nWhat steps do you follow?\nHow could they be done differently?\nWhat information do you use?\nWhat inputs do you use?\nWhat outputs do you produce?\nFigure 2-6 Themes for information- \ngathering questions\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "51\nCHAPTER 2 \u25a0 Investigating System Requirements\nHow Are the Business Processes Performed?\u2002 \u2003 Determining how business pro-\ncesses are performed begins with the current system but gradually moves to the \nnew system. The goal is to define how the new system should support the func-\ntion rather than how it supports it now. The analyst must be able to help the \nuser visualize new and more efficient approaches to performing the business \nprocesses made possible by new technology or processes.\nWhat Information Is Required?\u2003 Some information inputs are formal; others are \ninformal. When questioning the user, the analyst should specifically ask about \nexceptions or unusual situations in order to identify additional (nonroutine) in-\nformation requirements. In this theme and the previous one, detail is the watch-\nword. An analyst must understand the nitty-gritty detail to develop a correct \nsolution.\n\u275a\n\u275aQuestion Types\nQuestions can be roughly divided into two types:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nopen-ended questions\u2014such as \u201cHow do you do this function?\u201d\u2014\nencourage discussion and explanation.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nclosed-ended questions\u2014such as \u201cHow many forms a day do you \n\u00ad\nprocess?\u201d\u2014are used to get specific facts.\nGenerally, open-ended questions help to start a discussion and enable a large \nnumber of requirements to be uncovered fairly quickly. Note that all the ques-\ntions in the previous section are open ended. A discussion that starts with open-\nended questions usually shifts gradually to closed-ended questions that elicit or \nconfirm specific details of a business process.\n\u275a\n\u275aFocus of Questions\u2014Current System or New?\nA significant question that faces all analysts is how much effort to expend study-\ning and documenting the existing system (if one exists). Excess attention to an \nexisting system can consume considerable time and can result in simply updat-\ning that system with newer technology. As a result, no matter how inefficient \nthe current system is, system developers simply reimplement the procedures that \nare already in place. On the other hand, if a new system inherits many or all of \nthe requirements of an existing system, then an analyst risks missing important \nrequirements through insufficient study of the existing system.\nTo minimize both risks, analysts must balance the review of current busi-\nness functions with discovery of new system requirements. It is still critical to \nhave a complete, correct set of system requirements, but in today\u2019s fast-paced \nworld, there is no time or money to review all the old systems and document all \nthe inefficient procedures. In fact, in today\u2019s development environment, one of \nthe most valuable capabilities that a good system developer can bring is a new \nperspective to the problem.\n\u275a\n\u275aInterview Preparation, Conduct, and Follow-Up\nFigure 2-7 is a sample checklist that summarizes the major points to be covered; \nit is useful in preparing for, conducting, and following up an interview.\nPreparing for the Interview\u2003 Every successful interview requires preparation. \nThe\u00a0first and most important step in preparing for an interview is to establish \nits objective. In other words, you must determine what you want to accomplish \nwith this interview. Write down the objective so it is firmly established in your \nmind. The second step is to determine which stakeholders should be interviewed. \nA small number of interviewees is generally best when the objective is narrow or \nof a fact-finding nature. Larger groups are better if the objective is more open \nended, such as when generating and evaluating new ideas. However, it can be \nopen-ended questions\u2003 questions that \nencourage discussion or explanation\nclosed-ended questions\u2003 questions that \nelicit specific facts\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

If possible, have at least two analysts involved in every \ninterview, and have them compare notes afterward to ensure accuracy.\nThe next step is to prepare detailed questions to be used in the interview. \nWrite down a list of specific questions, and prepare notes based on the forms or \nreports received earlier. Usually, you should prepare a list of questions that are \nconsistent with the objective of the interview. Open-ended questions and closed-\nended questions are both appropriate. Generally, open-ended questions help get \nthe discussion started and encourage the user to explain all the details of the \nbusiness process and the rules.\nThe last step is to make the final interview arrangements and then com-\nmunicate those arrangements to all participants. A specific time and location \nshould be established. If possible, a quiet location should be chosen to avoid \ninterruptions. Each participant should know the objective of the meeting and, \nwhen appropriate, should have a chance to preview the questions or materials to \nbe used. Interviews consume a substantial amount of time, and they can be made \nmore efficient if each participant knows beforehand what is to be accomplished.\nConducting the Interview\u2003 The usual rules of workplace meetings apply dur-\ning stakeholder interviews: Plan ahead, arrive early, and ensure that the room \nis prepared and that needed resources are available. Limit the time of the in-\nterview for the benefit of the analyst(s) and stakeholder(s); stakeholders have \nother responsibilities, and the analysts can absorb only so much information at \none time. It is better to have several shorter interviews than one long interview. \nA\u00a0\u00ad\nseries of interviews provides an opportunity to absorb the material and then \nreturn for clarification later if needed.\nLook for exception and error conditions. Look for opportunities to ask \n\u201cwhat if\u201d questions. \u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t arrive? What if the signature is miss-\ning? What if the balance is incorrect?

In addition to looking for exception conditions, the ana-\nlyst must probe to ensure a complete understanding of all procedures and rules. \nOne of the most difficult skills to learn as a new systems analyst is how to get \nenough details. Frequently, it is easy to get a general overview of how a pro-\ncess works; but do not be afraid to ask detailed questions until you thoroughly \nunderstand how the process works and what information is used. You cannot do \neffective systems analysis by glossing over the details.\nTake careful notes. It is a good idea to take handwritten notes. Usually, \ntape recorders make users nervous. However, taking notes signals that you think \nthe information you are obtaining is important, and the user is complimented. \nIf\u00a0two analysts conduct each interview, they can compare notes later.

{"text": "54\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nFollowing up the Interview\u2003 Follow-up is an important part of each interview. \nThe first task is to absorb, understand, and document the information that was \nobtained. Generally, analysts document the details of the interview by con-\nstructing models of the business processes and writing textual descriptions of \nnonfunctional requirements. These tasks should be completed as soon after the \ninterview as possible and the results distributed to the interview participants for \nvalidation. If the modeling methods are complex or unfamiliar to the users, the \nanalyst should schedule follow-up meetings to explain and verify the models, as \ndescribed in the last section of this chapter.\nDuring the interview, you probably asked some \u201cwhat if\u201d questions that \nthe users could not answer. They are usually policy questions raised by the new \nsystem that management has not considered before. It is extremely important \nthat these questions not get lost or forgotten. Figure 2-9 shows a sample table \nfor tracking outstanding or unresolved issues for RMO. The table includes ques-\ntions posed by users or analysts and responsibilities assigned for resolving the \nissues. If several teams are working, a combined list can be maintained. Other \ncolumns that might be added to the list are an explanation of the problem\u2019s reso-\nlution and the date resolved.\nFinally, make a list of new questions based on areas that need further elabo-\nration or that are missing information. This list will prepare you for the next \ninterview.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Distribute and Collect Questionnaires\nQuestionnaires enable analysts to collect information from a large number of \nstakeholders. Even if the stakeholders are widely distributed geographically, they \ncan still help define requirements through questionnaires. Questionnaires are \noften used to obtain preliminary insight into stakeholder information needs, \nwhich helps to determine areas that need further research using other methods.\nFigure 2-10 is a sample questionnaire showing three types of questions. \nThe first part has closed-ended questions to determine quantitative information. \nThe second part consists of opinion questions in which respondents are asked \nwhether they agree or disagree with the statement. Both types of questions are \nuseful for tabulating and determining quantitative averages. The third part \nrequests an explanation of a procedure or problem. Questions such as these are \ngood as a preliminary investigation to help direct further fact-finding activities.\nQuestionnaires are not well suited to helping you learn about processes, \nworkflows, or techniques. Open-ended questions such as \u201cHow do you do \nthis process?\u201d are best answered by using interviews or observation. Although \na questionnaire can contain a very limited number of open-ended questions, \nstakeholders frequently do not return questionnaires that contain many open-\nended questions.\nID\nIssue title \nDate identified\nTarget\nend date \nResponsible\nproject person\nUser contact\nComments\n1\nPartial\nshipments \n6-12-2016\n7-15-2016\nJim Williams\nJason Nadold\nShip partials or wait\nfor full shipment? \n2\nReturns and\ncommissions\n7-01-2016\n9-01-2016\nJim Williams\nWilliam\nMcDougal\nAre commissions\nrecouped on\nreturns?\n3\nExtra\ncommissions\n7-01-2016\n8-01-2016\nMary Ellen Green \nWilliam\nMcDougal\nHow to handle com-\nmissions on special\npromotions? \nFigure 2-9 Sample open-items list\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Second, existing inputs, \noutputs, and documents can serve as visual aids for the interview and as the \nworking documents for discussion (see Figure 2-11). Discussion can focus on a \nspecific input or output, its objective, its distribution, and its information con-\ntent. The discussion should also include specific business events that initiate \nthe use of an input or generation of an output. Several different business events \nmight require the same form, and specific information about the event and the \nbusiness process is critical. It is always helpful to have screens and forms that \nhave been filled out with real information to ensure that the analyst obtains a \ncorrect understanding of the data content.\nReviewing the documentation of existing procedures helps identify busi-\nness rules that may not come up in the interviews. Analyzing formal procedure \ndocumentation also helps reveal discrepancies and redundancies in the business \nprocesses. However, procedure documents frequently are not kept up to date, \nand they commonly include errors. To ensure that the assumptions and business \nrules that derive from the existing documentation are correct, analysts should \nreview them with the users.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Observe and Document Business Processes\nFirsthand experience is invaluable to understand exactly what occurs within \nbusiness processes. More than any other activity, observing a business process in \naction will help you understand the business functions.

{"text": "57\nCHAPTER 2 \u25a0 Investigating System Requirements\nYou can observe a business process in many ways, ranging from a quick \nwalk-through of an office or plant to doing the work yourself. A quick walk-\nthrough gives a general understanding of the layout of the office, the need \nfor and use of computer equipment, and the general workflow. Spending sev-\neral hours observing users at their jobs helps you understand the details of \nusing the computer system and carrying out business functions. Being trained \nas a user and actually doing the job enables you to discover the difficulties of \nlearning new procedures, the importance of a system that is easy to use, and \nthe stumbling blocks and bottlenecks of existing procedures and information \nsources.\nIt is not necessary to observe all processes at the same level of detail. A\u00a0quick \nwalk-through may be sufficient for one process, whereas a process that is critical \nor more difficult to understand might require an extended observation period. \nIf you remember that the objective is a complete understanding of the business \nprocesses and rules, you can assess where to spend your time to gain that under-\nstanding. As with interviewing, it is usually better if two analysts combine their \nefforts in observing procedures.\nObservation often makes the users nervous, so you need to be as unobtrusive \nas possible. You can put users at ease in several ways, such as by working along-\nside a user or observing several users at once. Common sense and sensitivity to \nthe needs and feelings of the users will usually result in a positive experience.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Research Vendor Solutions\nMany of the problems and opportunities that companies want to address with \nnew information systems have already been solved by other companies. In addi-\ntion, consulting firms often have experience with the same problems, and soft-\nware firms may have packaged solutions for a particular business need. Taking \nadvantage of existing knowledge or solutions can avoid costly mistakes and save \ntime and money.\nThere are three positive contributions and one danger in exploring existing \nsolutions. First, researching existing solutions will frequently help users generate \nnew ideas for how to better perform their business functions. Seeing how some-\none else solved a problem and applying that idea to the culture and structure of \nthe existing organization will often provide viable alternative solutions for busi-\nness needs.\nSecond, some of these solutions are excellent and state of the art. Without \nincluding this research, the development team may create a system that is obso-\nlete even before it is designed. Companies need solutions that not only solve \nbasic business problems, but that are up to date with competitive practices.\nThird, it is often cheaper and less risky to buy a solution rather than to build \nit. If the solution meets the needs of the company and can be purchased, then \nthat is usually a safer, quicker, and less-expensive route.\nThe danger in exploring existing solutions is that the users and even the \nsystems analysts may want to buy one of the alternatives immediately. But if \na solution, such as a packaged software system, is purchased too early in the \nprocess, the company\u2019s needs may not be thoroughly investigated. Too many \ncompanies have purchased systems only to find out later that they only support \nhalf the functions that were needed. Do not rush into a purchase decision until \nrequirements are fully defined and all viable alternatives have been thoroughly \ninvestigated.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Collect Active User Comments and Suggestions\nAs discussed in Chapter 1 and earlier in this chapter, system development nor-\nmally proceeds with analysis, design, and other activities spread across mul-\ntiple iterations.

Users and other stakeholders perform the initial testing of system \nfunctions during the iteration in which those functions are implemented. They \nalso test and use those same functions during later iterations.\nUser feedback from initial and later testing is a valuable source of require-\nments information. Yet, interviews, discussions, and model reviews are an \nimperfect way of eliciting complete and accurate requirements. The phrase \u201cI\u2019ll \nknow it when I see it\u201d applies well to requirements definition. Users often can-\nnot completely or accurately state their requirements until they can interact with \na live system that implements those requirements. Based on those interactions, \nusers can develop concrete suggestions for improvement and identify missing or \npoorly implemented requirements.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Models and Modeling\nModeling is an important part of systems analysis and design. You saw many \ndifferent models in Chapter 1 for the Tradeshow System. Analysts build mod-\nels to describe system requirements and use those models to communicate with \nusers and designers. By developing a model and reviewing it with a user, an ana-\nlyst demonstrates an understanding of the user\u2019s requirements. If the user spots \nerrors or omissions, they are incorporated into the model before it becomes the \nbasis for subsequent design and implementation activities. Figure 2-12 summa-\nrizes the key reasons for building and using models.\nDesigners construct high-level and detailed models to describe system \ncomponents and their interactions. Design models serve as a scratch pad for \nevaluating design alternatives and as a way to communicate the final design to \nprogrammers, vendors, and others who will build, acquire, and assemble com-\nponents to create the final system. In general, models built during one SDLC \nactivity are \u201cconsumed\u201d during other activities.\nA model is a representation or abstraction of some aspect of the system \nbeing built. There are dozens of different models that an analyst or designer \nmight develop and use (see Figure 2-13). Although this book emphasizes mod-\nels and techniques for creating models, it is important to remember that system \nprojects vary in the number of models required and in their formality. Smaller, \nsimpler system projects will not need models showing every system detail, par-\nticularly when the project team has experience with the type of system being \nbuilt. Sometimes, the key models are created informally in a few hours. Although \nmodels are often created by using specialized software tools, useful and impor-\ntant models are sometimes drawn quickly over lunch on a paper napkin or in \nan airport waiting room on the back of an envelope! As with any development \nactivity, an iterative approach is used for creating models. The first draft of a \nmodel has some, but not all details worked out. The next iteration might fill in \nmore details or correct previous misconceptions.\nLearning from the modeling process\nReducing complexity by abstraction\nRemembering all the details\nCommunicating with other development team members\nCommunicating with a variety of users and stakeholders\nDocumenting what was done for future maintenance/enhancement\nFigure 2-12 Reasons for \nmodeling\nmodel\u2003 representation or abstraction of \nsome aspect of a system\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "59\nCHAPTER 2 \u25a0 Investigating System Requirements\nAnalysis and design models can be grouped into three generic types:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nTextual models.  Analysts use such textual models as memos, reports, \nnarratives, and lists to describe requirements that are detailed and are diffi-\ncult to represent in other ways. The event list and use case descriptions (see \nicons shown in Figure 2-13) are two examples of textual models. Narrative \ndescription is often the best way to initially record information gathered \nverbally from stakeholders, such as during an interview.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nGraphical models. Graphical models make it easier to understand com-\nplex relationships that are difficult to follow when described as a list or \nnarrative. Recall the old saying that a picture is worth a thousand words. \nIn system development, a carefully constructed graphical model might be \nworth a million words! Some graphical models actually look similar to a \nreal-world part of the system, such as a screen design or a report layout \ndesign. However, the graphical models developed during analysis activities \ntypically represent more abstract things, such as external agents, processes, \ndata, objects, messages, and connections.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMathematical models. Mathematical models are one or more formulas \nthat describe technical aspects of a system. Analysts often use mathemati-\ncal models to represent functional requirements for scientific and engineer-\ning applications and occasionally use them to describe business system \nrequirements in areas such as accounting and inventory control. Analysts \nand designers use mathematical models to describe nonfunctional require-\nments and operational parameters such as network throughput or database \nquery response time.\nMany graphical models used in system development are drawn accord-\ning to the notation specified by the Unified Modeling Language (UML). In \n\u00ad\nFigure 2-13, the use case diagram, class diagram, activity diagram, sequence \ndiagram, communication diagram, and state machine diagram are UML graphi-\ncal models.

{"text": "60\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nunderstand a variety of specific diagrams used in a system development project. \nPrior to UML, there was no standard, so diagrams could be confusing, and they \nvaried from company to company (and from book to book).\nIn later chapters, you will learn how to develop many of these analysis and \ndesign models. The first UML diagram covered in detail is the activity diagram.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Documenting Workflows with Activity Diagrams\nAs you gather information about business processes, you will need to document \nyour results as a workflow. A workflow is the sequence of work steps that com-\nplete one business transaction or customer request. Workflows may be simple or \ncomplex. Complex workflows can be composed of dozens or hundreds of work \nsteps and may include participants from different parts of an organization.\nOne effective way to capture this information is with a UML activity dia-\ngram. An activity diagram describes the various user (or system) activities, the \nperson or component that completes each activity, and the sequential flow of \nthese activities.\nFigure 2-14 shows the basic symbols used in an activity diagram. The flat-\ntened ovals represent the individual activities in a workflow. The connecting \narrows represent the sequence of the activities. The black circles denote the \nbeginning and the ending of the workflow. The diamond is a decision point at \nwhich the flow of the process will either follow one path or another. The heavy \nsolid line is a synchronization bar, which either splits the path into multiple \nconcurrent paths or recombines concurrent paths. The swimlane represents an \nagent who performs the activities. It is called a swimlane because each agent fol-\nlows a path parallel with other agents in the workflow, as with swimmers in a \nswimming pool.\nFigure 2-15 is an activity diagram that describes the order fulfillment pro-\ncess for the current RMO CSMS. Processing begins when the customer has \ncompleted the order checkout process and the warehouse begins order fulfill-\nment. The diagram describes the back-and-forth flow of information and con-\ntrol between the order subsystem, inventory subsystem, warehouse(s), and \nshipper. The diagram is simplified because it omits many error-handling path-\nways, including what happens if enough item stock is on hand to fulfill only part \nof an order.\nworkflow\u2003  a sequence of work steps that \ncompletely handle one business transaction \nor customer request\nactivity diagram\u2003 a UML diagram that \ndescribes user (or system) activities, the per-\nson or component that completes each activ-\nity, and the sequential flow of these activities\nsynchronization bar\u2003 an activity diagram \ncomponent that either splits a control path \ninto multiple concurrent paths or recombines \nconcurrent paths\nswimlane\u2003 an activity diagram component \nthat divides the workflow activities into \ngroups showing which agent performs which \nactivity\nEnding activity\n(Pseudo)\nActivity\nTransition arrow\nStarting activity\n(Pseudo)\nDecision\nactivity\nAnother way\nto show decision \nSynchronization\nbar (Split)\nSynchronization\nbar (Join)\nManager\nReview\nfinancials\nPrepare\nreport\n[yes]\n[no]\nSwimlane\nheading\nFigure 2-14 Activity diagram \nsymbols\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

However, John and Jacob has been able \nto cultivate a substantial customer base from upper-middle-\nincome clients in the northeastern United States. To main-\ntain a competitive edge with its customers, John and Jacob \nis in the process of modernizing its online trading system. \nThe modernization will add new features to the existing sys-\ntem and expand the range of interfaces beyond desktop and \nlaptop computers to include tablet computers and smart-\nphones.

Obviously, the brokers who are going to use \nthe system need to have input, but how should this be \ndone? Edward also is not sure what approach would \nbe best to ensure that the requirements are complete \nwithout requiring tremendous amounts of time from the \nstakeholders. Including all the offices would increase \nenthusiasm and support for the system, but it would \nincrease the time required to compile the information. \nFurthermore, involving more brokers would bring diver-\ngent opinions that would have to be reconciled.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCustomers. The trading system will also include trade \norder entry, investment analysis reports, trade confir-\nmations, standard and customized reporting, and cus-\ntomer statements. Edward wonders how to involve \nJohn and Jacob customers in the development of sys-\ntem requirements. Edward is sensitive to this issue \nbecause many brokers have told him that their cus-\ntomers are unhappy with the current system, and cus-\ntomer complaints are sometimes posted to the public \ncomments area of the current Web site. He would like \nto involve customers, but he does not know how.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nOther stakeholders. Edward knows he should involve \nother stakeholders to help define system requirements. \nHe is not quite sure whom he should contact. Should he \ngo to senior executives? Should he contact middle man-\nagement? Should he include such back-office functions \nas accounting and investing? He is not quite sure how to \nget organized or how to decide who should be involved.\n1.\t\nWhat is the best method for Edward to involve the \nbrokers (users) in the development of the updated \nonline trading system? Should he use a questionnaire? \nShould he interview the brokers in each of the com-\npany\u2019s 30 offices or would one or two brokers repre-\nsenting the entire group be better? How can \u00ad\nEdward \nensure that the information about requirements is \ncomplete, yet not lose too much time doing so?\n2.\t\nConcerning customer input for the new system, how can \nEdward involve customers in the process?

Students have booked spring break trips for \ndecades, but changes in technology have transformed \nthe travel business in recent years. SBRU moved away \nfrom having campus reps with posted fliers and moved \nto the Web early on. The basic idea is to get a group \nof students to book a room at a resort for one of the \ntraditional spring break weeks. SBRU contracts with \ndozens of resorts in key spring break destinations like \nFlorida, Texas, the Caribbean, and Mexico. Its Web \nsite shows information on each resort and includes \nprices, available rooms, and special features. Students \ncan research and book a room, enter contract infor-\nmation, and pay deposits and final payments through \nthe system. SBRU provides updated booking informa-\ntion, resort information updates, and travel informa-\ntion for booked students when they log in to the site.\nThe resorts also need access to information from \nSBRU. They need to know about their bookings for \neach week, the room types that are booked, and so \nforth. Before the spring break booking season starts, \nthey need to enter information on their resorts, includ-\ning prices and special features. Resorts need to be paid \nby SBRU for the bookings, and they need to be able to \nreport and collect for damages caused by spring break-\ners during their stay.\nSBRU has recently decided to upgrade its system \nto provide social networking features for students.

Over several months, \nhe observed that there appeared to be a substantial \nneed for courier services in the city in which he lived. \nHe decided that he would form his own courier deliv-\nery company called On the Spot to fill this need.\nBill began by listing his mobile telephone number \nin the Yellow Pages. He also sent letters to all those \ncompanies that had requested same-day courier ser-\nvice that his prior company had not been able to serve. \nHe hoped that through good service and word-of-\nmouth advertising that his business would grow. He \nalso began other advertising and marketing activities \nto promote his services.\nAt first, Bill received delivery requests on his busi-\nness mobile phone.

With the addition \nof a new person, he could no longer \u201cwarehouse\u201d the \npackages out of his delivery van.

Monitoring that once \nrequired a visit to a health-care facility can now be \nperformed by devices located in a patient\u2019s home, or \ncarried or worn at all times. Examples include mea-\nsures of glucose level (blood sugar), pulse, blood pres-\nsure, and electrocardiogram (EKG). Measurements \ncan be transmitted via telephone, Internet connection, \nand wireless data transmission standards, such as \nBluetooth. A particularly powerful technology combi-\nnation is a wearable device that records data periodi-\ncally or continuously and transmits it via Bluetooth to \na cell phone app. The cell phone app can inform the \npatient of problems and can automatically transmit \ndata and alerts to a central monitoring application (see \nFigure 2-17).\nHealth-care providers and patients incur sig-\nnificant costs when glucose levels are not maintained \nwithin acceptable tolerances. Short-term episodes of \nvery high or very low glucose often result in expensive \nvisits to urgent care clinics or hospitals. In addition, \npatients with frequent but less severe episodes of high \nor low glucose are more susceptible to such expensive, \nlong-term complications as vision, circulatory, and \nkidney problems.\nSandia Medical Devices (SMD), an Albuquerque \nmanufacturer of portable and wearable medical moni-\ntoring devices, has developed a glucose monitor em-\nbedded in a wristband.

The Bick-\nfords worked for restaurants while in college and always \ndreamed of opening their own restaurant; unfortunately, \nthe initial investment was always out of reach. The Bick-\nfords noticed that many restaurants offer takeout food, \nand that some restaurants\u2014primarily pizzerias\u2014offer \nhome-delivery service. However, many people they \nmet seemed to want home delivery with a wider food \nselection.\nSue and Tom conceived Waiters on Call as the best \nof both worlds: a restaurant service without the high \ninitial investment. They contracted with a variety of \nwell-known restaurants in town to accept orders from \ncustomers and to deliver the complete meals. After pre-\nparing the meal to order, the restaurant charges Waiters \non Call a wholesale price, and the customer pays retail \nplus a service charge and tip when the meals are deliv-\nered. Waiters on Call started modestly, with only two \nrestaurants and one delivery driver working the dinner \nshift. Business rapidly expanded, until the Bickfords real-\nized they needed a custom computer system to support \ntheir operations. They hired a consultant, Sam Wells, to \nhelp them define what sort of system they needed.\n\u201cWhat events happen when you are running your \nbusiness that make you want to reach for a computer?\u201d \nasked Sam. \u201cTell me about what usually goes on.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d answered Sue, \u201cwhen a customer calls in \nwanting to order, I need to record it and get the informa-\ntion to the right restaurant. I need to know which drivers \nare available to pick up the order, so I need drivers to call \nin and tell me when they are free. Perhaps this could \nbe included as a smartphone or iPad app. Sometimes, \ncustomers call back wanting to change their orders, so I \nneed to find the original order and notify the restaurant \nto make the change.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s great. Now, how do you handle the \nmoney?\u201d queried Sam.\nTom jumped in. \u201cThe drivers get a copy of the bill \nshowing the retail price directly from the restaurant \nwhen they pick up the meal. The bill should agree with \nour calculations. The drivers collect that amount plus a \nservice charge. When drivers report in at closing, we \nadd up the money they have and compare it with the \nrecords we have. After all drivers report in, we need to \ncreate a deposit slip for the bank for the day\u2019s total re-\nceipts. At the end of each week, we calculate what we \nowe each restaurant at the agreed-to wholesale price \nand send them a statement and check.\u201d\n\u201cWhat other information do you need to get from \nthe system?\u201d continued Sam.\n\u201cIt would be great to have some information at the \nend of each week about orders by restaurant and or-\nders by area of town\u2014things like that,\u201d Sue said. \u201cThat \nwould help us decide about advertising and restaurant \ncontracts. Then, we need monthly statements for our \naccountant.\u201d\nSam made some notes and sketched some dia-\ngrams as Sue and Tom talked. Then, after spending \nsome time thinking about it, he summarized the situa-\ntion for Waiters on Call. \u201cIt sounds to me like you need a \nsystem to use whenever these events occur\u201d:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nA customer calls in to place an order, so you need to \nRecord an order.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nA driver is finished with a delivery, so you need to \nRecord delivery completion.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nA customer calls back to change an order, so you \nneed to Update an order.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nA driver reports for work, so you need to Sign in the \ndriver.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nA driver submits the day\u2019s receipts, so you need to \nReconcile driver receipts.\nSam continues, \u201cThen, you need the system to \nproduce information at specific points in time\u2014for \nexample, when it is time to,\u201d\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nProduce an end-of-day deposit slip.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nProduce end-of-week restaurant payments.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nProduce weekly sales reports.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nProduce monthly financial reports.\n\u201cAm I on the right track?\u201d\nSue and Tom quickly agreed that Sam was talking \nabout the system in a way they could understand. They \nwere confident that they had found the right consultant \nfor the job.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

These models are \ncreated as part of the analysis activity Define requirements, although remember \nthat the analysis activities are actually done in parallel with design and imple-\nmentation and in each iteration of the project.\nIn the Waiters on Call case, Sam Wells is working with the Bickfords to \nidentify the functional requirements for the new system using the event decom-\nposition technique. The sketch he was drawing was a use case diagram. You \nwill learn about this technique and others that help identify user stories and use \ncases in this chapter.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0User Stories and Use Cases\nAs you saw in Chapter 1, identifying user stories and use cases is a key task \nwhen defining functional requirements because these form the basis for the list \nof functions the system needs to carry out. Virtually all recent approaches to \nsystem development begin the requirements modeling activity with the concept \nof a user story or a use case. These two concepts are similar in that they focus \non the goals of the user, and they show the list of functions at the appropriate \nlevel of detail. But they differ in the approach taken to identify them and in the \namount of detail that is captured by the analyst. User stories are favored by \nhighly Agile system development methodologies, and they are turned over to the \nprogrammer analyst much earlier than use cases are. The programmer analyst \ndesigns and codes each user story to discover needed details. The Agile devel-\nopment philosophy is to work directly with users and avoid doing too much \ndocumentation. In contrast, a use case approach traditionally meant analysts \ncomplete much documentation for each use case, focusing on detailed steps car-\nried out by the user and the system. In practice, use cases can also be very brief \nfor Agile development.\nA user story is usually one short sentence in the everyday language of \n \nthe end user that states what a user does as part of his or her work. In other \nwords, a user story describes a goal the user has when using the system. \n \nUser stories are a basic concept in Agile development because they focus on \nsimplicity, value added, and user collaboration. They document the functional \nrequirements quickly and less formally than traditional requirements modeling \nby focusing on who, what, and why for each function. The users and stakehold-\ners are responsible for identifying the user stories.\nIn meetings with stakeholders, analysts encourage participants to write out \neach user story on an index card or on a shared whiteboard app. The objective \nis to get a potential user to articulate what he or she wants to do with the new \nsystem. A standard template helps users think through what they want and why \nthey want it. The standard template for a user story looks like this:\n\u201cAs a <role played>, I want to <goal or desire> so that <reason or benefit>.\u201d\nFor example, some user stories for a bank teller might be:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u201cAs a teller, I want to make a deposit to quickly serve more customers.\u201d\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u201cAs a teller, I want to balance the cash drawer to assure there were no \nerrors.\u201d\nAs a customer of the bank using an ATM machine, some user stories might be:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u201cAs a bank customer, I want to withdraw cash and feel confident the stack \nof cash I get is the correct amount.\u201d\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u201cAs a bank customer, I want to deposit a check and feel confident the \ndeposit is recorded correctly.\u201d\nuser story\u2003 one short sentence in the every-\nday language of the end user that states what \na user does as part of his or her work\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "72\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nA final part of a user story is the acceptance criteria. These indicate the \nfeatures that must be present for the user to be satisfied with the resulting imple-\nmentation. They focus on functionality, not on features or user-interface design. \nFor example, the following are the acceptance criteria for the user story \u201cbank \nteller making a deposit\u201d:\n1.\t Customer lookup must be by name or by account number.\n2.\t It would be nice to display photo and signature of customer.\n3.\t Any check hold requirements must be indicated.\n4.\t Current balance and new balance must be displayed.\nThe programmer analyst uses the acceptance criteria to clarify the expec-\ntations of the user and to verify the user is looking at the user story at an \nappropriate level of analysis. When the user story is implemented and refined, \nthe acceptance criteria are used for testing. Some consider it much like a con-\ntract between the developers and the users that limits controversy later in the \nproject. Figure 3-1 shows two user stories handwritten on index cards.

The other user \nstory is for a shipping clerk responsible for shipping the items on a new order \nfor RMO.\nUser Story\nAs a teller, I want to make a deposit to quickly serve more customers.\nAcceptance Criteria:\n1.

{"text": "73\nCHAPTER 3 \u25a0 Identifying User Stories and Use Cases\nA use case is an activity the system performs in response to a request by \na user. In Chapter 1, the RMO Tradeshow System example had a list of uses \nthat included Look up supplier, Enter/update product information, and Look \nup product information. Two techniques are recommended for identifying use \ncases: the user goal technique and the event decomposition technique. Use case \ntechniques place the responsibility for identifying and detailing the require-\nments on the system developers. The developers typically interview all types \nof users and stakeholders, and then make and refine notes about each use case. \nSome of the more complex use cases are modeled in more detail by the develop-\ners before turning the uses cases over to the programmer analysts for design \nand implementation.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Use Cases and the User Goal Technique\n\u201cUser stories will help analysts identify and define use cases, which are the pri-\nmary focus of this chapter.\u201d\nOne approach to identifying use cases, called the user goal technique, is \nto ask users to describe their goals for using the new or updated system. The \nanalyst first identifies all the users, categorizes them by user type, and then con-\nducts a structured interview with each user. By focusing on one type of user at a \ntime, the analyst can systematically address the problem of identifying use cases.\nDuring the interview, the analyst guides the user to identify specific ways \nthe computer system could help the user perform his or her assigned tasks. \nThe\u00a0overarching objective is to identify what the system could do to improve the \nuser\u2019s performance and productivity. Subsidiary goals might include streamlin-\ning tasks the user currently performs, or enabling the user to perform new tasks \nthat are not possible or practical with the current system. As these goals are \nuncovered and described, the analyst probes for specific requests from the user \nand desired responses from the proposed system, which the analyst documents \nas use cases. Although the users are the ultimate source of this information, they \noften require guidance from the analyst to think beyond the boundaries of the \nways they currently approach their jobs.\nConsider various user goals for the RMO Consolidated Sales and \n\u00ad\nMarketing System (CSMS) introduced in Chapter 2. In an example like this, \nthe analyst might talk to the people in the Shipping Department to identify \ntheir \u00ad\nspecific goals. These might include: Ship items, Track shipment, and \n\u00ad\nCreate item return. The Marketing Department might identify goals like \nAdd/update \u00ad\nproduct information, Add/update promotion, and Produce sales \nhistory report. When considering the goals of the prospective customer, the \nanalyst might ask RMO users from different departments to think about the \nsystem from the \u00ad\ncustomer\u2019s viewpoint and to imagine the value-added features \nand functions that would make RMO appealing and useful. Additionally, focus \ngroups of actual customers might be formed to pinpoint their wants and needs. \nGoals identified for potential customers might include Search for item, Fill \nshopping cart, and View product rating and comments. Figure 3-2 lists a few \nof the user goals for potential users of the CSMS. Note that for the Shipping \npersonnel, there is a use case named Ship order, which corresponds to the same \nuser story identified in Figure 3-1.\nThe user goal technique for identifying use cases includes these steps:\n1.\t Identify all the potential users for the new system.\n2.\t Classify the potential users in terms of their functional role (e.g., shipping, \nmarketing, sales).\n3.\t Further classify potential users by organizational level (e.g., operational, \nmanagement, executive).\nuse case\u2003 an activity that the system \nperforms in response to a request by a user\nuser goal technique\u2003 a technique to \n\u00ad\nidentify use cases by determining what \n\u00ad\nspecific goals or objectives must be \n\u00ad\ncompleted by the system for the user\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The event decomposition technique begins by identify-\ning all the business events the information system responds to, with each event \nleading to a use case. Starting with business events helps the analyst define each \nuse case at the appropriate level of detail. For example, one analyst might iden-\ntify a use case as typing in a customer name on a form. A second analyst might \nidentify a use case as the entire process of adding a new customer. A third ana-\nlyst might even define a use case as working with customers all day, which could \ninclude adding new customers, updating customer records, deleting customers, \nfollowing up on late-paying customers, or contacting former customers. The \nfirst example is too narrow to be useful. Conversely, working with customers all \nday\u2014the third example\u2014is too broad to be useful. The second example defines \na complete user goal, which is the right level of analysis for a use case.\nThe appropriate level of detail for identifying use cases is one that focuses on \nelementary business processes (EBPs). An EBP is a task that is performed \nby one person in one place in response to a business event, adds measurable \nbusiness value, and leaves the system and its data in a stable and consistent state. \nIn Figure 3-2, the RMO CSMS potential customer use cases Search for item, \nFill shopping cart, and View product rating and comments are good examples \nof elementary business processes. Fill shopping cart is a response to the business \nevent \u201cCustomer wants to shop.\u201d There is one person filling the cart, and there \nis measurable value for the customer as items are added to the cart. When the \ncustomer stops adding items and moves to another task, the system remembers \nthe current cart and is ready to switch to the new task.\nNote that each EBP (and thus each use case) occurs in response to a busi-\nness event. An event occurs at a specific time and place, can be described, and \nshould be remembered by the system. Events drive or trigger all processing that \na system does, so listing events and analyzing them makes sense when you need \nto define system requirements by identifying use cases.\nUser\nUser goal and resulting use case \nPotential customer\nSearch for item \nFill shopping cart \nView product rating and comments\nMarketing manager\nAdd/update product information\nAdd/update promotion\nProduce sales history report \nShipping personnel \nShip order\nTrack shipment\nCreate item return\nFigure 3-2 Identifying use cases \nwith the user goal technique\nevent decomposition technique\u2003 a tech-\nnique to identify use cases by determining the \nbusiness events to which the system must \nrespond\nelementary business processes (EBP)\u2003  \nthe most fundamental task in a business \nprocess, which leaves the system and data in \na quiescent state; usually performed by one \nperson in response to a business event\nevent\u2003 something that occurs at a specific \ntime and place, can be precisely identified, \nand must be remembered by the system\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "75\nCHAPTER 3 \u25a0 Identifying User Stories and Use Cases\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Event Decomposition Technique\nWhen defining the requirements for a system, it is useful to begin by asking, \n\u201cWhat business events occur that will require the system to respond?\u201d By asking \nabout the events that affect the system, you direct your attention to the external \nenvironment and look at the system as a black box. This means you don\u2019t see \nthe underlying functions, just the input and results. This initial perspective helps \nkeep your focus on a high-level view of the system (looking at the scope), rather \nthan on the inner workings of the system. It also focuses your attention on the \nsystem\u2019s interfaces with outside people and other systems.\nSome events that are important to a retail store\u2019s charge account \n\u00ad\nprocessing system are shown in Figure 3-3. The functional requirements are \ndefined by use cases based on six events. A customer triggers three events: \n\u201ccustomer pays a bill,\u201d \u201ccustomer makes a charge,\u201d and \u201ccustomer changes \naddress.\u201d The system responds with three use cases: Record a \u00ad\npayment, \n\u00ad\nProcess a charge, or Maintain customer data. Three other events are \u00ad\ntriggered \ninside the system by reaching a point in time: \u201ctime to send out monthly \n\u00ad\nstatements,\u201d \u201ctime to send late notices,\u201d and \u201ctime to produce end-of-week \nsummary reports.\u201d The system responds with use cases that carry out what \nit is time to do: Produce monthly statements, Send late notices, and Produce \nsummary reports. Describing this system in terms of events keeps the focus of \nthe charge account system on the business requirements and the elementary \nbusiness processes. The result is a list of use cases triggered by business events \nat the right level of analysis.\nUsing events to define functional requirements was first emphasized for \nreal-time systems in the early 1980s.

{"text": "76\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nto events in the environment. Early real-time systems include manufacturing \nprocess control systems and avionics guidance systems. For example, in process \ncontrol, if a vat of chemicals is full, then the system needs to Turn off the fill \nvalve. The relevant event is \u201cvat is full,\u201d and the system needs to respond to that \nevent immediately. In an airplane guidance system, if the plane\u2019s altitude drops \nbelow 5,000 feet, then the system needs to Turn on the low-altitude alarm.\nMost information systems now being developed are so interactive that \nthey can be thought of as real-time systems. In fact, people expect a real-time \nresponse to almost everything. Thus, use cases for business systems are often \nidentified by using the event decomposition technique.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Types of Events\nThere are three types of events to consider when using the event decomposi-\ntion technique to identify use cases: external events, temporal events, and state \nevents (also called internal events). The analyst begins by trying to identify \nand list as many of these events as possible, refining the list while talking with \n\u00ad\nsystem users.\n\u275a\n\u275aExternal Events\nAn external event is an event that occurs outside the system\u2014usually initiated \nby an external agent or actor. An external agent (or actor) is a person or orga-\nnizational unit that supplies or receives data from the system. To identify the \nkey external events, the analyst first tries to identify all the external agents that \nmight want something from the system. A classic example of an external agent is \na customer. The customer may want to place an order for one or more products. \nThis event is of fundamental importance to an order-processing system, such as \nthe one needed by Ridgeline Mountain Outfitters. But other events are associ-\nated with a customer. Sometimes, a customer wants to return an ordered prod-\nuct, or a customer needs to pay the invoice for an order. External events such as \nthese define what the system needs to be able to do. They are events that lead to \nimportant transactions that the system must process.\nWhen describing external events, it is important to name the event so the \nexternal agent is clearly defined. The description should also include the action \nthat the external agent wants to pursue. Thus, the event \u201cCustomer places an \norder\u201d describes the external agent (a customer) and the action that the customer \nwants to take (to place an order for some products) that directly affects the system.\nImportant external events can also result from the wants and needs of peo-\nple or organizational units inside the company (e.g., management requests for \ninformation). A typical event in an order-processing system might be \u201cManage-\nment wants to check order status.\u201d Perhaps managers want to follow up on an \norder for a key customer; the system must routinely provide that information.\nAnother type of external event occurs when external entities provide new \ninformation that the system simply needs to store for later use. For example, a \nregular customer reports a change in address, phone, or employer. Usually, one \nevent for each type of external agent can be described to handle updates to data, \nsuch as \u201cCustomer needs to update account information.\u201d Figure 3-4 provides a \nchecklist to help in identifying external events.\nexternal event\u2003 an event that occurs \noutside the system, usually initiated by an \nexternal agent\nactor\u2003 an external agent; a person, group \nor external system that interacts with the \nsystem by supplying or receiving data\nExternal events to look for include:\n\u221a External agent wants something resulting in a transaction\n\u221a External agent wants some information\n\u221a Data changed and needs to be updated\n\u221a Management wants some information\nFigure 3-4 External event \nchecklist\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "77\nCHAPTER 3 \u25a0 Identifying User Stories and Use Cases\n\u275a\n\u275aTemporal Events\nA second type of event is a temporal event\u2014an event that occurs as a result \nof reaching a point in time. Many information systems produce outputs at \ndefined intervals, such as payroll systems that produce a paycheck every two \nweeks (or each month). Sometimes, the outputs are reports that management \nwants to receive regularly, such as monthly or weekly performance or excep-\ntion reports. These events are different from external events in that the system \nshould automatically produce the required output without being told to do so. \nIn other words, no external agent or actor is making demands, but the system is \nsupposed to generate information or other outputs when they are needed.\nThe analyst begins identifying temporal events by asking about specific \ndeadlines that the system must accommodate. What outputs are produced at \nthat deadline? What other processing might be required at that deadline? In a \npayroll system, a temporal event might be named \u201cTime to produce biweekly \npayroll.\u201d The event defining the need for a monthly summary report might be \nnamed \u201cTime to produce monthly sales summary report.\u201d Figure 3-5 provides \na checklist to use in identifying temporal events.\nTemporal events do not have to occur on a fixed date. They can occur after \na defined period of time has elapsed. For example, a bill might be given to a cus-\ntomer when a sale has occurred. If the bill has not been paid within 15 days, the \nsystem might send a late notice. The temporal event \u201cTime to send late notice\u201d \nmight be defined as a point 15 days after the billing date.\n\u275a\n\u275aState Events\nA third type of event is a state event\u2014an event that occurs when something hap-\npens inside the system that triggers the need for processing. State events are also \ncalled internal events. For example, if the sale of a product results in an adjustment \nto an inventory record, and the inventory in stock drops below a reorder point, it \nis necessary to reorder. The state event might be named \u201cReorder point reached.\u201d \nOften, state events occur as a consequence of external events. Sometimes, they are \nsimilar to temporal events, except the point in time cannot be defined.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Identifying Events\nDefining the events that affect a system is not always easy, but some guidelines \ncan help an analyst think through the process.\n\u275a\n\u275aEvents Versus Prior Conditions and Responses\nIt is sometimes difficult to distinguish between an event and part of a sequence \nof prior conditions that leads up to the event. Consider a customer buying a \nshirt from a retail store (see Figure 3-6). From the customer\u2019s perspective, this \npurchase involves a long sequence of events.

The analyst has to think \nthrough such a sequence to arrive at the point where an event directly affects the \nsystem. In this case, the system is not affected until the customer is in the store, \nhas a shirt in hand ready to purchase, and says \u201cI want to buy this shirt.\u201d\nIn other situations, it is not easy to distinguish between an external event \nand the system\u2019s response. For example, when the customer buys the shirt, the \nsystem requests a credit card number and then the customer supplies the credit \ncard. Is the act of supplying the credit card an event? In this case, no; it is part of \nthe interaction that occurs while completing the original transaction.\nThe way to determine whether an occurrence is an event or whether it is \npart of the interaction following the event is by asking if any long pauses or \nintervals occur (i.e., can the system transaction be completed without interrup-\ntion?). Or\u00a0is the system at rest again, waiting for the next transaction? After the \ncustomer wants to buy the shirt (the event), the process continues until the trans-\naction is complete. There are no significant stops after the transaction begins. \nAfter the transaction is complete, the system is at rest, waiting for the next \ntransaction to begin. The EBP concept defined earlier describes this as leaving \nthe system and its data in a consistent state.\nOn the other hand, separate events occur when the customer buys the shirt by \nusing his store credit card account. When the customer pays the bill at the end of \nthe month, is the processing part of the interaction involving the purchase? In\u00a0this \ncase, no; the system records the transaction and then does other things. It\u00a0does not \nhalt all processes to wait for the payment. A separate event occurs later that results \nin sending the customer a bill. (This is a temporal event: \u201cTime to send monthly \nbills.\u201d) Eventually, another external event occurs \u00ad\n(\u201cCustomer pays the bill\u201d).\n\u275a\n\u275aThe Sequence of Events: Tracing a Transaction\u2019s Life Cycle\nA useful method for identifying events is to trace the sequence of events that \nmight occur for a specific external agent or actor. In the case of Ridgeline \nMountain Outfitters\u2019 new CSMS, the analyst can think through all the possible \ntransactions that might result from one new customer (see Figure 3-7). First, \nthe customer wants a catalog or asks for some information about item avail-\nability, resulting in a name and address being added to the database. Then, the \ncustomer might want to place an order. Perhaps he or she will want to change \nthe order\u2014for example, correcting the size of the shirt or buying another shirt. \nCustomer thinks\nabout getting a\nnew shirt\nCustomer drives to\nthe mall\nCustomer tries on a\nshirt at Sears\nCustomer goes to\nWalmart\nCustomer tries on a\nshirt at Walmart\nCustomer buys\na shirt\nFigure 3-6 Sequence of actions \nthat lead up to only one event  \naffecting the system\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Perhaps the customer has moved and wants an address change \nrecorded for future catalog mailings. Finally, the customer might want to return \nan item. Thinking through this type of sequence can help identify events.\n\u275a\n\u275aTechnology-Dependent Events and System Controls\nSometimes, the analyst is concerned about events that are important to the sys-\ntem, but do not directly concern users or transactions. Such events typically \ninvolve design choices or system controls. During analysis, the analyst should \ntemporarily ignore these events. However, they are important later for design.\nSome examples of events that affect design issues include external events \nthat refer to the physical system, such as logging on. Although important to the \nfinal operation of the system, such implementation details should be deferred. \nAt this stage, the analyst should focus only on the functional requirements (i.e., \nthe work that the system needs to complete). A functional requirements model \ndoes not need to indicate how the system is actually implemented, so the model \nshould omit the implementation details.\nMost of these physical system events involve system controls, which are \nchecks or safety procedures put in place to protect the integrity of the system. For \nexample, logging on to a system is required because of system security controls. \nOther controls protect the integrity of the database, such as backing up the data \nevery day. These controls are important to the system, and they will certainly be \nadded to the system during design. But spending time on system controls during \nanalysis only adds details to the requirements model that users are not typically \nvery concerned about; they trust the system developers to take care of such details.\nOne way to help decide which events apply to system controls is to assume \nthat technology is perfect. The perfect technology assumption states that \nevents should be included during analysis only if the system would be required \nto respond under perfect conditions (i.e., with equipment never breaking down, \ncapacity for processing and storage being unlimited, and people operating the \nsystem being completely honest and never making mistakes). By pretending that \ntechnology is perfect, analysts can eliminate events like \u201cTime to back up the \ndatabase\u201d because they can assume that the disk will never crash. Again, during \ndesign, the project team adds these controls because technology is obviously not \nperfect. Figure 3-8 lists some examples of events that can be deferred until the \ndeveloper is designing in system controls.\nCustomer requests a\ncatalog\nCustomer wants to check\nitem availability\nCustomer places\nan order\nCustomer changes or\ncancels an order\nCustomer wants to\ncheck order status\nCustomer updates\naccount information\nCustomer returns\nthe item\nFigure 3-7 The sequence of \u201ctransactions\u201d for one specific customer resulting in many events\nsystem controls\u2003 checks or safety proce-\ndures to protect the integrity of the system \nand the data\nperfect technology assumption\u2003 the \nassumption that a system runs under perfect \noperating and technological conditions\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "81\nCHAPTER 3 \u25a0 Identifying User Stories and Use Cases\nwhich subsystem is responsible for each use case. The analyst should also iden-\ntify which use cases involve more than one type of user.\nIt is important to recognize that this list of uses cases will continue to evolve \nas the project progresses. Additional use cases will be added, some might be \neliminated, and some might be combined. It is helpful to immediately describe \nsome of the details of each use case, preferably in one sentence. This brief \ndescription is usually expanded to record more of the details when the develop-\ners are designing and implementing the use case (see Chapter 5). Some exam-\nples of brief use case descriptions are shown in Figure 3-9. Figures 3-10a \nthrough 3-10e show the initial list of use cases for the RMO CSMS along with \nthe users. Note that many use cases have more than one user.\nSometimes, it is useful to create diagrams that visually depict use cases and \nhow they are organized. The use case diagram is the UML model used to \nillustrate use cases and their relationship to users. Recall from Chapter 2 that \nUnified Modeling Language (UML) is the standard set of diagrams and model \nconstructs used in system development. You saw an example of a use case dia-\ngram in Chapter 1. The notation is fairly simple.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Use Cases, Actors, and Use Case Diagram Notation\nImplied in most use cases is a person who uses the system, whom we have \nreferred to up to this point as the user. In UML, that person is called an actor. \nAn actor is always outside the automation boundary of the system but may be \npart of the manual portion of the system. Sometimes, the actor for a use case is \nnot a person; instead, it can be another system or device that receives services \nfrom the system.\nFigure 3-11 shows the basic parts of a use case diagram. A simple stick \nfigure represents an actor. The stick figure is given a name that characterizes \nthe role the actor is playing. The use case itself is represented by an oval with \nthe name of the use case inside. The connecting line between the actor and \nthe use case indicates that the actor is involved with that use case. Finally, the \n\u00ad\nautomation boundary, which defines the border between the computerized \nportion of the application and the people operating the application, is shown \nas a rectangle containing the use case. The actor\u2019s communication with the use \ncase crosses the automation boundary. The example in Figure 3-11 shows the \nactor as a shipping clerk and the use case Ship items.\n\u275a\n\u275aUse Case Diagram Examples\nFigure 3-12 shows a more complete use case diagram for a subsystem of \nthe RMO CSMS: the Customer Account subsystem. The information in \n\u00ad\nFigure\u00a03-10c is recast as a single use case diagram to visually highlight the uses \ncases and actors for an individual subsystem. In this example, the customer, \ncustomer service representative, and store sales representative are all allowed to \naccess the system directly. As indicated by the relationship lines, each actor can \naccess the\u00a0use case Create/update customer account. The customer might do \nUse case \nCreate customer account\nLook up customer\nProcess account adjustment\nBrief use case description \nUser/actor enters new customer account data, and the system\nassigns account number, creates a customer record, and \ncreates an account record.\nUser/actor enters customer account number, and the system\nretrieves and displays customer and account data.\nUser/actor enters order number, and the system retrieves \ncustomer and order data; actor enters adjustment amount, and\nthe system creates a transaction record for the adjustment.\nFigure 3-9 Use cases and brief \ndescriptions\nbrief use case description\u2003 an often \none-sentence description that provides a \nquick overview of a use case\nuse case diagram\u2003 the UML model used \nto illustrate use cases and their relationships \nto actors\nautomation boundary\u2003 the boundary \nbetween the computerized portion of the \napplication and the users who operate the \napplication but are part of the total system\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The other use cases are included only \nfor the customer.\nThere are many ways to organize use case diagrams for communicating with \nusers, stakeholders, and project team members. One way is to show all use cases \ninvoked by a particular actor (i.e., from the user\u2019s viewpoint). This approach is \noften used during requirements definition because the systems analyst may be \nworking with a particular user and identifying all the functions that user per-\nforms with the system.

A key early step in the modeling process is to \nidentify and list the user stories or use cases that de-\nfine the functional requirements for the system. User \nstories are written by end users and stakeholders dur-\ning requirements meetings with the developers. They \nare used with most highly Agile development meth-\nodologies. Use cases are very similar to user stories, \nbut they are often modeled in more detail than user \nstories and are the responsibility of the developers. Use \ncases can be identified by using the user goal technique \nand the event decomposition technique. The user goal \ntechnique initially identifies types of system end us-\ners, called actors. Then, users are asked to list specific \nuser goals they have when using the system to support \ntheir work. The event decomposition technique ini-\ntially identifies events that require a response from the \nsystem. An event is something that can be described, \nsomething that occurs at a specific time and place, and \nsomething worth remembering. External events occur \noutside the system\u2014usually triggered by someone who \ninteracts with the system. Temporal events occur at a \ndefined point in time, such as the end of a work day or \nthe end of every month. State or internal events occur \nbased on an internal system change. For each event, \na use case is identified and named. The event decom-\nposition technique helps ensure that each use case is \nidentified at the elementary business process (EBP) \nlevel of detail. Each use case identified by the analyst \nis further documented by a brief use case description \nand by identifying the actors. UML use case diagrams \nare drawn to document use cases and their actors. \nMany different use case diagrams are drawn based on \nthe need to review use cases with various stakeholders, \n \nusers, and team members.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

What is an example of an event of \neach type in the checklist? Name each event by \nusing the guidelines for naming an external event.\n\t\n3.\tReview the temporal event checklist in Figure\u00a03-5. \nWould a student grade report be an internal or \nexternal output? Would a class list for the instruc-\ntor be an internal or external output? What are \nsome other internal and external outputs for a \ncourse registration system?

(3) Kevin decides to save \nhis money. (4) Kevin goes to the bank. (5) Kevin \nwaits in line. (6) Kevin makes a deposit in his sav-\nings account. (7) Kevin grabs the deposit receipt. \n(8) Kevin asks for a brochure on auto loans.\n\t\n5.\tConsider the perfect technology assumption, \nwhich states that use cases should be included \nduring analysis only if the system would be \nrequired to respond under perfect conditions. \nCould any of the use cases listed for the RMO \nCSMS be eliminated based on this assumption? \nExplain. Why are such use cases as Log on to the \nsystem and Back up the database required only \nunder imperfect conditions?\n\t\n6.\tVisit some Web sites of car manufacturers, such \nas Honda, BMW, Toyota, and Acura. Many of \nthese sites have a use case that is typically named \nBuild and price a car. As a potential customer, \nyou can select a car model, select features and \noptions, and get the car\u2019s suggested price and list \nof specifications. Write a brief use case descrip-\ntion for this use case (see Figure 3-9).\n\t\n7.\tAgain looking at a Web site for one of the car \nmanufacturers, consider yourself a potential \nbuyer and then identify all the use cases included \non the site that correspond to your goals.\n\t\n8.\tSet up a meeting with a librarian. During your \nmeeting, ask the librarian to describe the situ-\nations that the book checkout system needs to \nrespond to. List these external events. Now ask \nabout points in time, or deadlines, that require \nthe system to produce a statement, notice, report, \nor other output. List these temporal events. Does \nit seem natural for the librarian to describe the \nsystem in this way? List each event and then \nname the resulting use case.\n\t\n9.\tAgain considering the library, ask some students \nwhat their goals are in using the library system. \nAlso ask some library employees about their \ngoals in using the system. Name these goals as use \ncases (verb-noun) and discuss whether student \nusers have different goals than employee users.\n\t 10.\tVisit a restaurant or the college food service to \ntalk to a server (or talk with a friend who is a \nfood server).

{"text": "90\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nThe State Patrol Ticket-Processing \nSystem\nThe purpose of the State Patrol ticket-processing system is \nto record moving violations, keep records of the fines paid by \ndrivers when they plead guilty or are found guilty of moving \nviolations, and notify the court that a warrant for arrest should \nbe issued when such fines are not paid in a timely manner. \nA separate State Patrol system records accidents and the \nverification of financial responsibility (insurance). But a third \nsystem uses ticket and accident records to produce driving \nrecord reports for insurance companies. Finally, a fourth sys-\ntem issues, renews, or suspends driver\u2019s licenses. These \nfour systems are obviously integrated, in that they share ac-\ncess to the same database; otherwise, they are operated \nseparately by different departments of the State Patrol.\nWhen an officer gives a ticket to a driver, a copy of \nthe ticket is turned in and entered into the system. A new \nticket record is created, and relationships to the correct \ndriver, officer, and court are established in the database. \nIf the driver pleads guilty, he or she mails in the fine in a \npreprinted envelope with the ticket number on it. In some \ncases, the driver claims innocence and wants a court date. \nWhen the envelope is returned without a check and the trial \nrequest box has an \u201cX\u201d in it, the system does the following: \nnotes the plea on the ticket record; looks up driver, ticket, \nand officer information; and sends a ticket details report \nto the appropriate court. A trial date questionnaire form is \nalso produced at the same time and is mailed to the driver. \nThe instructions on the questionnaire tell the driver to fill in \nconvenient dates and mail the questionnaire directly to the \ncourt. Upon receiving this information, the court schedules \na trial date and notifies the driver of the date and time.\nWhen the trial is completed, the court sends the \nverdict to the ticketing system. The verdict and trial date \nare recorded for the ticket. If the verdict is innocent, the \nsystem that produces driving record reports for insurance \ncompanies will ignore the ticket. If the verdict is guilty, \nthe court gives the driver another envelope with the ticket \nnumber on it for mailing in the fine.\nIf the driver fails to pay the fine within the required \nperiod, the ticket-processing system produces a warrant \nrequest notice and sends it to the court. This happens if \nthe driver does not return the original envelope within two \nweeks, or does not return the court-supplied envelope \nwithin two weeks of the trial date. What happens next is \nin the hands of the court. Sometimes, the court requests \nthat the driver\u2019s license be suspended, and the system that \nprocesses driver\u2019s licenses handles the suspension.\n1.\t\nTo what events must the ticket-processing system \n\u00ad\nrespond? List each event, the type of event, the \nresulting use case, and the actor(s). Think carefully \nabout who the actors are. Does the officer directly \nenter the ticket into the system? Or does a state pa-\ntrol clerk do it when the paper ticket is received from \nthe officer? The existing system uses paper forms, so \nfor now assume the state patrol clerk enters all of the \ninformation. A new system would use the same use \ncases, but opportunities for efficiency and accuracy \nwould lead to changes in who the actors are.\n2.\t\nWrite a brief use case description for each use case.\n3.\t\nDraw a use case diagram for the ticket-processing \nsystem assuming the actors are based on your \nanswers in question 1 (the existing system as \ndescribed).\nCASE STUDY\nCommunity Board of Realtors\u00ae\nOne of the functions of the Board of Realtors intro-\nduced in Chapter 2 is to provide a Multiple Listing \nService (MLS) system that supplies information that \nlocal real estate agents use to help them sell houses to \ntheir customers. Agents list houses for sale (listings) by \ncontracting with homeowners. The agent works for \na real estate office, which sends information on the \nlisting to the MLS. Therefore, any agent in the com-\nmunity can get information on the listing.\nThe MLS systems include lots of information on \na listing. It is now common to include dozens of pho-\ntos, video tours, Google map information, prior sales, \nand so forth. For now, let\u2019s keep it simple and assume \na listing includes the address, year built, square feet, \nRunning Case Studies\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

An agent will directly request information from \nthe MLS system on listings that match customer re-\nquirements. Information is provided on the house, on \nthe agent who listed the house, and on the real estate \noffice for which the agent works. This information is \nneeded because an agent might want to call the listing \nagent to ask additional questions or call the homeowner \ndirectly to make an appointment to show the house. \nAlthough it seems dated, once each week, the MLS \nproduces a listing booklet that contains information \non all listings. These booklets are sent to some real es-\ntate agents because many think they are easier to flip \nthrough and write on. Sometimes, agents and owners \ndecide to change information about a listing, such as re-\nducing the price, correcting previous information on the \nhouse, or indicating that the house is sold. The agent \nupdates the information directly on the MLS system.\n\t\n1.\tTo what events must the MLS system respond \nbased on the description above?

Consider the following description of the \nBooking subsystem. A few weeks before Thanksgiving \nbreak, it is time to open the system to new bookings. \nStudents usually want to browse through the resorts \nand do some planning. When a student or group of \nstudents wants to book a trip, the system allows it. \nSometimes, a student needs to be added or dropped \nfrom the group or a group changes size and needs a \ndifferent type of room. One month before the actual \ntrip, it is time for the system to send out final payment \nrequirement notices. Students cancel the booking or \nthey pay their final bills. Students often want to look \nup their booking status and check on resort details. \nWhen they arrive at the resort, they need to check in; \nand when they leave, they need to check out.\n\t\n1.\tUsing the event decomposition technique for \neach event you identify in the description here, \nname the event, state the type of event, and \nname the resulting use case.

Draw \na use case diagram for these use cases.\nOn the Spot Courier Services\nRecall the On the Spot courier service introduced \nin Chapter 2. The details of the package pickup and \ndelivery process are described here.\nWhen Bill got an order, only on his phone at first, \nhe recorded when he received the call and when the \nshipment would be ready for pickup. Sometimes, cus-\ntomers wanted immediate pickup; sometimes, they \nwere calling to schedule a later time in the day for \npickup.\nOnce he arrived at the pickup location, Bill \n\u00ad\ncollected the packages. It was not uncommon for \nthe customer to have several packages for delivery. \nIn \u00ad\naddition to the name and address of the delivery \n\u00ad\nlocation, he also \u00ad\nrecorded the time of pickup. He \nnoted the desired delivery time, the location of the \ndelivery, and the weight of the package to determine \nthe \u00ad\ncourier cost. When he picked up the package, he \nprinted out a label with his portable printer that he \nkept in the \u00ad\ndelivery van.\nAt first, Bill required customers to pay at the time \nof pickup, but he soon discovered that there were some \nregular customers who preferred to receive a monthly \nbill for all their shipments. He wanted to be able to ac-\ncommodate those customers. Bills were due and pay-\nable upon receipt.\nTo help keep track of all the packages, Bill de-\ncided that he needed to scan each package as it was \nsorted in the warehouse. This would enable him to \nkeep good control of his packages and avoid loss or \ndelays.\nThe delivery of a package was fairly simple. Upon \n\u00ad\ndelivery, he would record information about when the \n\u00ad\ndelivery was made and who received it.

As the project began, interviews with pa-\ntients and physicians about potential RTGM capa-\nbilities and interaction modes identified several areas \nof concern that will need to be incorporated into the \nsystem requirements and design. The relevant patient \nconcerns include:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nViewing and interpreting data and trends.  \nPatients want to be able to view more than their \ncurrent glucose level. They would like to see \nglucose levels over various time periods, with a \nspecific focus on time periods during which their \nglucose was within and outside of acceptable \nranges. A graphical view of the data is preferred, \nalthough some patients also want to be able to \nsee actual numbers.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEntering additional data. Some patients want \nto be able to enter text notes or voice messages \nto supplement glucose level data. For example, \npatients who see a high glucose alert might \nrecord voice messages describing how they feel \nor what they had recently eaten. Some patients \nthought that sharing such information with \ntheir health-care providers might be valuable, \nbut others only wanted such information for \nthemselves.\nPhysicians expressed these concerns:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nThey do not want to be the \u201cfirst line of \n\u00ad\nresponse\u201d to all alerts.

This chapter focuses on another \nkey concept that defines requirements: things in the problem domain of system \nusers. You first learned about these as domain classes in Chapter 1. You might \nhave learned about these as data entities when studying database management, \nas they define the sources for the tables used in a relational database manage-\nment system. Nearly all approaches to system development include identifying \nand modeling domain classes or data entities as an important task in the analy-\nsis activity Define functional requirements.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\u201cThings\u201d in the Problem Domain\nDomain classes or data entities are what end users deal with when they do their \nwork\u2014for example, products, sales, shippers, shipments, and customers. These \nare often referred to as \u201cthings\u201d in the context of a system\u2019s problem domain. \nThe problem domain is the specific area of the user\u2019s business that is included \nwithin the scope of the new system. The new system involves working with \nand remembering these \u201cthings.\u201d For example, some information systems need \nto store information about customers and products, so it is important for the \nanalyst to identify all the important information about them. Often, things are \nrelated to the people who interact with the system or to other stakeholders. For \nexample, a customer is a person who places an order, but the system needs to \nstore information about that customer, so a customer is also a thing in the prob-\nlem domain.\nThere are many techniques for identifying the important things in the prob-\nlem domain that the system needs to remember. Two of them are introduced in \nthis chapter: the brainstorming technique and the noun technique.\nOpening case\u2002 Waiters on Call Meal-Delivery System (Part 2)\nRecall that Waiters on Call has been working with Sam \nWells on the requirements for its meal-delivery system. \nSue and Tom Bickford want a new system that will auto-\nmate and improve their specialty business of providing \ncustomer-ordered, home-delivered meals prepared by a \nvariety of local restaurants. Sam did a great job of iden-\ntifying the use cases required for the delivery service, \nwhich impressed the Bickfords. And while working on \nthe use cases, he continued to note all the business \nterms and concepts that the Bickfords used as they \ndescribed their operations. He followed up with ques-\ntions about the types of things they work with each day, \nwhich they answered.\n\u201cBased on what you\u2019ve told me,\u201d Sam said, \n\u201cI\u00a0assume you will need the system to store infor-\nmation about the following types of things, which \nwe call data entities or domain classes: restaurants, \nmenu items, customers, and orders. I also think you\u2019re \ngoing to need to store information about the following \ntypes of things: drivers, addresses, routes, and order \npayments.\u201d\nThe Bickfords readily agreed and added that it was \nimportant to know what route a restaurant was on and \nhow far it might be to the customer\u2019s address. They \nwanted drivers to be assigned to a route based on the \ndistances from place to place.\n\u201cYes, we need to decide how things need to be \nassociated in the system,\u201d Sam agreed. \u201cCan you tell \nme if drivers pick up orders from several restaurants \nwhen they go out? Can you tell me how many items are \nusually included in one order? Do you note pickup times \nand delivery times?

{"text": "95\nCHAPTER 4 \u25a0 Domain Modeling\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The Brainstorming Technique\nAs with use cases, an analyst should ask the users to discuss the types of things \nthey work with routinely. The analyst can ask about several types of things to \nhelp identify them. Different types of things are important to different users, \nso it is important to involve all types of users to help identify problem domain \nthings. The brainstorming technique is used to identify problem domain \nclasses where developers work with users to identify different types of things \nthat they use in their work.\nFigure 4-1 shows some types of things to consider that can be used to system-\natically help users do brainstorming. Tangible things are often the most obvious, \nsuch as an airplane, a book, or a vehicle. In the Ridgeline Mountain Outfitters case, \na product in the warehouse and a vehicle in the fleet are tangible things of impor-\ntance. Another common type of thing in an information system is a role played by \na person, such as an employee, a customer, a doctor, or a patient. The role of cus-\ntomer is obviously a very important one in the Ridgeline Mountain Outfitters case. \nMany things in the problem domain can fit into more than one type. For example, \na vehicle might be thought of as a device and also a tangible thing. Either way, the \nimportant point is to identify potential things in the problem domain.\nOther types of things can include organizational units, such as a division, depart-\nment, or workgroup. Similarly, a site or location, such as a warehouse, a store, or a \nbranch office, might be an important thing in a system. Finally, information about \nan incident or an interaction can be a thing\u2014information about an order, a service \ncall, a contract, or an airplane flight. A sale, a shipment, and a return are all impor-\ntant incidents in the RMO case. Sometimes, these incidents are thought of as associa-\ntions between things. For example, a sale is an association between a customer and \nan item of inventory. Initially, the analyst might simply list all these as things and \nthen make adjustments as required by different approaches to analysis and design.\nThe analyst identifies these types of things by thinking about each use case, \ntalking to users, and asking questions. For example, for each use case, what \ntypes of things are affected that the system needs to know about and store infor-\nmation about? The types of things shown in Figure 4-1 can be used to systemati-\ncally brainstorm about what types of things might be involved in each\u00a0use\u00a0case. \nWhen a customer wants to buy from the Web site, the system needs to store \ninformation about the customer, the items ordered, the details about the sale \nitself\u2014such as the date and payment terms\u2014and the location of the items to \nbrainstorming technique\u2003 a technique \nused to identify problem domain classes in \nwhich developers work with users to identify \nclasses by thinking about different types of \nthings they use in their work\nFigure 4-1 Types of things to use for the brainstorming technique\nsensor\ntimer\ncontroller\nassembly line\nproduction machine\nsorter\nprinter\ninventory bin\nDevices\nwarehouse\nbranch office\nfactory\nretail store\ndesktop\nSites/\nlocations\nflight\nservice call\nlogon\nlogoff\ncontract\npurchase\norder\npayment\nIncidents,\nevents, or\ninteractions\nairplane\nbook\nvehicle\ndocument\nworksheet\nTangible\nthings\nemployee\ncustomer\ndoctor\npatient\nend user\nsystem\nadministrator\nRoles\nplayed\nThings\ndivision\ndepartment\nsection\ntask force\nworkgroup\nOrganizational\nunits\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

For that one use case, the analyst can define tangible things (items \nordered), roles played (customer), incidents or events (the sale), sites/locations \n(warehouse), and organizational units (shipping).\nHere are the steps to follow when using the brainstorming technique:\n1.\t Identify a user and a set of use cases or user stories.\n2.\t Brainstorm with the user to identify things involved when carrying out the \nuse case\u2014that is, things about which information should be captured by \nthe system.\n3.\t Use the types of things (categories) to systematically ask questions about \npotential things, such as the following: Are there any tangible things you \nstore information about? Are there any locations involved? Are there roles \nplayed by people that you need to remember?\n4.\t Continue to work with all types of users and stakeholders to expand the \nbrainstorming list.\n5.\t Merge the results, eliminate any duplicates, and compile an initial list.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The Noun Technique\nAnother useful procedure for identifying things in the problem domain is called \nthe noun technique. Recall that a noun is a person, place, or thing. Therefore, \nidentifying nouns might help you identify what needs to be stored by the system. \nBegin by listing all the nouns that users mention when talking about the system. \nNouns used to describe events, use cases, user stories, and the actors are poten-\ntial things. Next, add to the list any additional nouns that appear in information \nabout the existing system or that come up in discussions with stakeholders about \nthe problem domain of the system. The list of nouns will become quite long, \nso the list will need to be trimmed and refined. How the noun technique dif-\nfers from the brainstorming technique is that the analyst lists all nouns without \nthinking too much about them and without talking about them with users. Only \nlater will the list be refined based on consultation with stakeholders and users.\nHere are the steps to follow when using the noun technique:\n1.\t Using the use cases, actors, and other information about the system\u2014\nincluding inputs and outputs\u2014identify all nouns. For the RMO CSMS, \nthe nouns might include the following: customer, product item, sale, con-\nfirmation, transaction, shipping, bank, change request, summary report, \nmanagement, transaction report, accounting, back order, back-order \nnotification, return, return confirmation, fulfillment reports, prospective \ncustomer, marketing, customer account, promotional materials, charge ad-\njustment, sale details, merchandising, and customer activity reports.\n2.\t Using other information from existing systems, current procedures, and cur-\nrent reports or forms, add items or categories of information needed. For the \nRMO CSMS, these might include more detailed information, such as price, \nsize, color, style, season, inventory quantity, payment method, and shipping \naddress. Some of these items might be additional things, and some might be \nspecific information (called attributes) about things you have already identi-\nfied. Refine the list and then record assumptions or issues to explore.\n3.\t As this list of nouns builds, you will need to refine it. Ask these questions \nabout each noun to help you decide whether you should include it:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Is it a unique thing the system needs to know about?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Is it inside the scope of the system I am working on?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Does the system need to remember more than one of these items?\n\t\nAsk these questions about each noun to decide whether you should exclude it:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Is it really a synonym for some other thing I have identified?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Is it really just an output of the system produced from other information \nI have identified?\nnoun technique\u2003 a technique used to \nidentify things in the problem domain by \nfinding and classifying the nouns in a dialog \nor description\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The attribute that \nuniquely identifies the thing is called an identifier or key. Sometimes, the iden-\ntifier is already established (a Social Security number, vehicle ID number, or \nproduct ID number). Sometimes, the system needs to assign a specific identifier \n(an invoice number or transaction number).\nA system may need to remember many similar attributes. For example, a \ncustomer has several names: a first name, a middle name, a last name, and pos-\nsibly a nickname. A compound attribute is an attribute that contains a collec-\ntion of related attributes, so an analyst may choose one compound attribute to \nrepresent all these names, perhaps naming it Customer full name. A customer \nmight also have several phone numbers: home phone number, office phone num-\nber, fax phone number, and cell phone number. The analyst might start out by \ndescribing the most important attributes but later add to the list. Attribute lists \ncan get quite long. Some examples of attributes of a customer and the values of \nattributes for specific customers are shown in Figure 4-3.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Associations among Things\nAfter recording and refining the list of things and determining potential \nattributes, the analyst needs to research and record additional information. \nMany important relationships among things are important to the system. An \nassociation is a naturally occurring relationship between specific things, such \nas an order is placed by a customer and an employee works in a department \n(see Figure 4-4). Is placed by and works in are two associations that naturally \noccur between specific things.

Similarly, it is quite important to store the fact that \nOrder 1043 for a shirt was placed by John Smith. In database management, the \nterm \u00ad\nrelationship is often used in place of association, which is the term used \nwhen modeling in Unified Modeling Language (UML). This book uses the term \nassociation because it emphasizes UML diagrams and terms.\nAssociations between things apply in two directions. For example, a cus-\ntomer places an order describes the association in one direction. Similarly, an \norder is placed by a customer describes the association in the other direction. \nIt is important to understand the association in both directions because some-\ntimes it might seem more important for the system to record the association in \none direction than in the other. For example, Ridgeline Mountain Outfitters \ndefinitely needs to know what items a customer ordered so the shipment can be \nprepared. However, it might not be initially apparent that the company needs to \nknow about the customers who have ordered a particular item. What if the com-\npany needs to notify all customers who ordered a defective or recalled product? \nKnowing this information would be very important, but the operational users \nmight not immediately recognize that issue.\nIt is also important to understand the nature of each association in terms \nof the number of links for each thing and in which direction. For example, a \ncustomer might place many different orders, but an order is placed by only one \ncustomer. In database management, the number of links that occur is referred \nto as the cardinality of the association. Cardinality can be one-to-one or one-\nto-many. The term multiplicity is used to refer to the number of links in UML \nand should be used when discussing UML models. Multiplicity is established for \neach direction of the association. Figure 4-5 lists examples of cardinality/multi-\nplicity associated with an order.\nIt is important to describe not just the multiplicity but also the range of \npossible values of the multiplicity (the minimum and maximum multiplicity). \nFor example, a particular customer might not ever place an order. In this case, \nthere are zero associations. Alternatively, the customer might place one order, \nmeaning one association exists. Finally, the customer might place two, three, or \neven more orders. The relationship for a customer placing an order can have a \nrange of zero, one, or more, usually indicated as zero or more. The zero is the \nminimum multiplicity, and more is the maximum multiplicity. These terms are \nreferred to as multiplicity constraints.\nIn some cases, at least one association is required (a mandatory as opposed \nto optional association). For example, the system might not record any informa-\ntion about a customer until the customer places an order. Therefore, the multi-\nplicity would read customer places one or more orders.\nA one-to-one association can also be refined to include minimum and maxi-\nmum multiplicity. For example, an order is placed by one customer; it is impos-\nsible to have an order if there is no customer. Therefore, one is the minimum \nMr. Jones has placed no order yet,\nbut there might be many placed\nover time.\n(Direction: Mr. Jones to Order)\nA particular order is placed by Mr.\nSmith.

Because there cannot be more \nthan one customer for each order, one is also the maximum multiplicity. Some-\ntimes, such an association is read as an order must be placed by one and only \none customer.\nThe associations described here are between two different types of things\u2014\nfor example, a customer and an order. These are called binary associations. \nSometimes, an association is between two things of the same type\u2014for example, \nthe association is married to, which is between two people. This type of asso-\nciation is called a unary association (and sometimes called a recursive asso-\nciation). Another example of a unary association is an organizational hierarchy \nin which one organizational unit reports to another organizational unit\u2014the \nPacking Department reports to Shipping, which reports to Distribution, which \nreports to Marketing.\nAn association can also be among three different types of things, when it \nis called a ternary association, or among any number of different types of \nthings, when it is called an n-ary association. For example, one particular \norder might be associated with a specific customer plus a specific sales represen-\ntative, requiring a ternary association.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The Entity-Relationship Diagram\nTraditional approaches to system development place a great deal of emphasis \non data requirements for a new system and use the term data entities for the \nthings about which the system needs to store information. Data requirements \ninclude the data entities, their attributes, and the relationships (called associa-\ntions in UML) among the data entities. The brainstorming technique and noun \ntechnique described earlier are used in the same way with data entities as with \ndomain classes used for UML modeling. A model commonly used by traditional \nanalysts and database analysts is called the entity-relationship diagram (ERD). \nThe ERD is not a UML diagram, but it is frequently used and is quite similar to \nthe UML domain model class diagram that is discussed later in this chapter.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Examples of ERD Notation\nOn the entity-relationship diagram, rectangles represent data entities, and the \nlines connecting the rectangles show the relationships among data entities. \nFigure 4-6 shows an example of a simplified entity-relationship diagram with \ntwo data entities: Customer and Order.

But other symbols \non the relationship line also represent the minimum and maximum cardinality \nconstraints. See Figure 4-7 for an explanation of ERD relationship symbols. \nThe model in Figure 4-6 actually says that a Customer places a minimum of \nzero Orders and a maximum of many Orders. Reading in the other direction, \nthe model says an Order is placed by at least one and only one Customer.\nCardinality constraints reflect the business policies defined by management. \nThe analyst does not decide that two customers cannot share one order. Rather, \nthe analyst must discover the underlying policy and accurately represent it using \ncardinality constraints. The analyst must be very careful not to invent policies \nby defining arbitrary cardinality constraints. When the discovery process raises \npolicy questions that haven\u2019t yet been answered\u2014the analyst must raise the \nquestion with management and let it decide on an appropriate policy.\nFigure 4-8 shows the model expanded to include the order items (one or \nmore specific items included on the order). Each order contains a minimum of \none and a maximum of many items (there could not be an order if it did not \ncontain at least one item). For example, an order might include a shirt, a pair of \nshoes, and a belt, and each of these items is associated with the order. This exam-\nple also shows some of the attributes of each data entity: A customer has a cus-\ntomer number, a name, a billing address, and several phone numbers. Each order \nhas an order ID, order date, and so on. Each order item has an item ID, quantity, \nand price. The attributes of the data entity are listed below the name, with the \nkey identifier listed first, usually followed by PK to indicate primary key.\nFigure 4-9 shows how the actual data in some transactions might look. \nJohn is a customer who has placed two orders. The first order, placed on Febru-\nary 4, was for two shirts and one belt. The second order, placed on March 29, \nwas for one pair of boots and two pairs of sandals. Mary is a customer who has \nnot yet placed an order. Recall that a customer might place zero or more orders. \nTherefore, Mary is not associated with any orders. Finally, Sara placed an order \non March 30 for three pairs of sandals.

{"text": "103\nCHAPTER 4 \u25a0 Domain Modeling\nLook again at the cardinality. Note that a customer must have at least \none account. The rationale for this is that the bank would not add a customer \nunless he or she was adding an account. Note also that the branch can have zero \naccounts. A branch might be added long before it opens its doors, so it is possible \nthat it is does not have any accounts. Additionally, there might be some branches \nthat do not have accounts, such as a kiosk at a university or airport. Note that \nan account must have at least one transaction. The rationale is that opening a \nnew account requires an initial deposit, which is a transaction. It is important to \nrecognize that questions about the cardinality and minimum and maximum car-\ndinality constraints need to be discussed and reviewed with stakeholders.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The Domain Model Class Diagram\nAs discussed previously, many current approaches to system development use \nthe term domain class rather than data entity and use concepts and notations \nbased on UML to model the things in the problem domain. These concepts come \nfrom the object-oriented approach to system development. A class is a category \nor classification used to describe a collection of objects. Each object belongs to \na class. Therefore, students Mary, Joe, and Maria belong to the class Student. \nClasses that describe things in the problem domain are called domain classes. \nDomain classes have attributes and associations. Multiplicity (called cardinality \nin an ERD) applies among classes. Initially, when defining requirements, the \napproach to modeling is very similar whether the analyst is using ERD or UML \ndiagrams.\nThe UML class diagram is used to show classes of objects for a system. \nOne type of UML class diagram that shows the things in the users\u2019 problem \ndomain is called the domain model class diagram. Another type of UML \nclass diagram is called the design class diagram, and it is used when designing \nsoftware classes. You will learn about the design class diagram in Chapter 12.\nOn a class diagram, rectangles represent classes, and the lines connecting \nthe rectangles show the associations among classes. Figure 4-11 shows such a \nsymbol for a single domain class: Customer. The domain class symbol is a rect-\nangle with two sections. The top section contains the name of the class, and \nthe bottom section lists the attributes of the class. Later, you will learn that the \ndesign class symbol includes a third section at the bottom for listing methods of \nthe class; methods do not apply to problem domain classes.\nClass names and attribute names use camelback (sometimes called \ncamelcase) notation, in which the words run together without a space or under-\nscore. Class names begin with a capital letter; attribute names begin with a low-\nercase letter (see Figure 4-11). Class diagrams are drawn by showing classes and \nassociations among classes. The examples used previously for the entity-relation-\nship diagram are redrawn by using UML domain class diagram notation in the fol-\nlowing section so you can compare them. Additionally, more complex issues about \nclasses and associations can be illustrated by using domain model class diagrams.\nclass\u2003 a category or classification of a set \nof objects or things\ndomain classes\u2003 classes that describes \nobjects from the problem domain\ncamelback or camelcase notation\u2003 when \nwords are concatenated to form a single word \nand the first letter of each embedded word is \ncapitalized\ndomain model class diagram\u2003 a class \ndiagram that only includes classes from the \nproblem domain\nclass diagram\u2003 a diagram consisting of \nclasses (i.e., sets of objects) and associations \namong the classes\nFigure 4-11 The UML domain \nclass symbol with name and \nattributes\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nThe name of the class\nAttributes: all objects in\nthe class have a value for\neach of these\nCustomer\ncustNumber\nname\nbillAddress\nhomePhone\nofficePhone\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Here, each class symbol includes two sections. In diagram nota-\ntion, you see that each Customer can place many Orders (a minimum of zero \nand a maximum of many) and that each Order is placed by one Customer. The \nassociations places and consists of can be included on the diagram for clarity, \nas shown in Figure 4-12, but this detail is optional. The multiplicity is one-to-\nmany in one direction and one-to-one in the other direction. The multiplicity \nnotation, shown as an asterisk on the line next to the Order class, indicates \nmany orders. The other association shows that an Order consists of one or more \nOrderItems, and each OrderItem is associated with one Order.\nSee Figure 4-13 for a summary of multiplicity notation.\nFigure 4-14 shows another example of a domain model class diagram, this \none for the bank with multiple branches that was discussed earlier and shown as \nan ERD. In this example, the UML notation for indicating an attribute that is \nan identifier or key is {key}.\nFigure 4-15 shows an example of a domain model class diagram with a \nmany-to-many association. At a university, courses are offered as course sec-\ntions, and a student enrolls in many course sections. Each course section con-\ntains many students. Therefore, the association between CourseSection and \nStudent is many-to-many. There are situations in which many-to-many associa-\ntions are appropriate, and they can be modeled as shown.\nOn closer analysis, analysts often discover that many-to-many associations \ninvolve additional data that are important and must be stored. For example, in \nFigure 4-15, where is the grade that each student receives for the course stored? \nThis is important data, and although the model indicates which course section \na student took, it does not have a place for the grade. Grade isn\u2019t an attribute of \nCourseSection alone. Nor is it an attribute of Student alone.

In UML, \nan association is one of many types of relationships, so you need to be more \nprecise when discussing UML diagrams than when discussing ERDs. With \nclass diagrams, there are actually three types of relationships among classes \nof objects: association relationships (discussed previously), generalization/\u00ad\nspecialization relationships, and whole-part relationships. This section discusses \ngeneralization/specialization relationships and whole-part relationships and \nshows how they are represented in UML class diagrams.\n\u275a\n\u275aGeneralization/Specialization Relationships\nGeneralization/specialization relationships are based on the idea that people \nclassify things in terms of similarities and differences. Generalizations are judg-\nments that group similar types of things. For example, there are several types of \nmotor vehicles: cars, trucks, and tractors. All motor vehicles share certain general \ncharacteristics, so a motor vehicle is a more general class. Specializations are judg-\nments that group different types of things. For example, special types of cars include \nsports cars, sedans, and sport utility vehicles. These types of cars are similar in some \nways yet different in other ways. Therefore, a sports car is a special type of car.\nA generalization/specialization relationship is used to structure or rank \nthese things from the more general to the more special. As discussed previ-\nously, classification refers to defining classes of things. Each class of things in \nthe hierarchy might have a more general class above it, called a superclass. \nAt the same time, a class might have a more specialized class below it, called a \n\u00ad\nsubclass. In\u00a0Figure 4-19, the class Car has three subclasses and one superclass \n(MotorVehicle). UML class diagram notation uses a triangle that points to the \nsuperclass to show a generalization/specialization hierarchy.\nmemberName\nyearsInBand\ninstrument\nBandMember\nbandName\nstyle\nyearFormed\nBand\nconcertDate\nlocation\naudienceCapacity\nstartTime\npriceRange\nConcert\ndateBooked\nperformanceOrder\nbasePay\nBooking\n1..*\n0..*\n1..*\n1..1\nFigure 4-18 A refined band \nbooking domain model class \ndiagram with an association class\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\ngeneralization/specialization relationships\u2003\n \na type of hierarchical relationship in which \nsubordinate classes are subsets of objects of \nthe superior classes; an inheritance hierarchy\nsuperclass\u2003 the superior or more general \nclass in a generalization/specialization \nrelationship\nsubclass\u2003 the subordinate or more special-\nized class in a generalization/specialization \nrelationship\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "108\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nWe mentioned that people structure their understanding by using gener-\nalization/specialization relationships. In other words, people learn by refining \nthe classifications they make about some field of knowledge. A knowledgeable \nbanker can talk at length about special types of loans and deposit accounts. \nA\u00a0knowledgeable merchandiser like John Blankens at Ridgeline Mountain \nOutfitters can talk at length about special types of outdoor activities and \nclothes. Therefore, when asking users about their work, the analyst is trying to \nunderstand the knowledge the user has about the work, which the analyst can \nrepresent by constructing generalization/specialization relationships. At some \nlevel, the motivation for the new CSMS project at RMO started with John\u2019s rec-\nognition that Ridgeline Mountain Outfitters might handle many special types of \nsales with a new system (online sales, telephone sales, and in-store sales). These \nspecial types of sales are shown in Figure 4-20.\nInheritance allows subclasses to share characteristics of their superclass. \nReturning to Figure 4-19, a car is everything any other motor vehicle is but also \nsomething special. A sports car is everything any other car is but also something \nspecial. In this way, the subclass \u201cinherits\u201d the characteristics of the superclass. In \nthe object-oriented approach, inheritance is a key concept that is possible because \nof generalization/specialization hierarchies. Sometimes, these are referred to as \ninheritance relationships. Another term often used to describe generalization/\nspecialization is an \u201cISA\u201d relationship. In other words, it makes sense to say, \u201ca \nSedan IS A special type of Car and a Car IS A special type of MotorVehicle.\u201d\nConsider Figure 4-20, which represents a partial domain model for a retail \nbusiness such as RMO. Attributes are included for each class in the hierarchy. Each \nmember of the Sale class has a saleDateTime attribute and a priorityCode attribute. \nEach InStoreSale has a storeID, clerkID, and registerID, but an OnlineSale and a \nTelephoneSale have other attributes. OnlineSale, InStoreSale, and TelephoneSale \ninherit the attributes from Sale, plus they have some special attributes of their own. \nAn OnlineSale actually has eight attributes (six from Sale and two additional). \nAn\u00a0InStoreSale has nine attributes, and a TelephoneSale has eight attributes.\nFigure 4-19 Generalization/specialization relationships for motor vehicles\nTractor\nTruck\nMotorVehicle\nSportUtility\nSedan\nSportsCar\nCar\nTrucks, cars, and tractors\nare special types of motor\nvehicles\nSports cars, sedans, and\nsport utilities are special\ntypes of cars\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\ninheritance\u2003 the concept that specializa-\ntion classes inherit characteristics of the \ngeneralization class\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Note that each subclass also inherits an \nassociation with a Customer, optionally a Branch, and one or more Transactions.\n\u275a\n\u275aWhole-Part Relationships\nAnother way that people structure information about things is by defining them \nin terms of their parts. For example, learning about a computer system might \ninvolve recognizing that the computer is actually a collection of parts: processor, \nmain memory, keyboard, disk storage, and monitor. A keyboard is not a special \ntype of computer; it is part of a computer, but it is also something separate. \nWhole-part relationships are used to show an association between one class \nand other classes that are parts of that class.\nThere are two types of whole-part relationships: aggregation and compo-\nsition. Aggregation refers to a type of whole-part relationship between the \naggregate (whole) and its components (parts), where the parts can exist sepa-\nrately. Figure 4-22 demonstrates the concept of aggregation in a computer sys-\ntem, with the UML diamond symbol representing aggregation. Composition \nrefers to whole-part relationships that are even stronger, where the parts, once \nassociated, can no longer exist separately. The UML diamond symbol is filled in \nsolid to represent composition. For example, think of a house that is made up \nof bathrooms, bedrooms, stairwell, and so forth.

As with \nany association relationship, multiplicity can apply, such as when a computer \nhas one or more storage devices.\nThe UML class diagram examples you have seen so far are domain model \nclass diagrams. The design class diagram is a refinement of the class diagram \nand is used to represent software classes in the new system. You will learn about \nthe process of converting the domain model class diagram to a design class dia-\ngram in Chapter 12.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The Ridgeline Mountain Outfitters Domain \nModel\u00a0Class\u00a0Diagram\nThe RMO CSMS involves many domain classes and many complex association \nand generalization/specialization relationships. A domain model class diagram \nfor an information system evolves as the project proceeds; and unlike the use \ncase diagrams, where many diagrams are created, there is eventually only one \ndomain model class diagram. Also, unlike the use case diagram, the domain \nmodel class diagram is not produced just for presentations. The process of devel-\noping and refining the domain model class diagram is how the analyst explores \nand learns about the problem domain. Therefore, the information depicted in \nthe domain model class diagram is very detailed and rich in specific meaning.\nThe Ridgeline Mountain Outfitters domain model class diagram is a varia-\ntion of the customer, order, and order item example shown in Figure 4-12. Most \nof the domain classes are from the list of nouns developed in Figure 4-2. Because \nthe model is fairly complex, an analyst might start by focusing on one subsystem \nat a time to reduce the complexity. Eventually, all subsystems can be combined \ninto one domain model.\n\u275a\n\u275aThe RMO Sales Subsystem\nFigure 4-23 shows a domain model class diagram for the RMO CSMS Sales \nsubsystem. The Sales subsystem mainly involves the customer, sale, sales items, \nproducts, promotions, and accessories. That is a good starting point, but there \nare also additional domain classes. Additionally, recall that the association rela-\ntionships are just as important as the classes, so these must be identified. There \nare also special types of sales and a shopping cart.\nIn Figure 4-23, each customer can be associated with one or more sales. \nNote that there are three special types of sales shown in the inheritance rela-\ntionships (in-store sale, online sale, and telephone sale), as discussed in the last \nsection. Therefore, the scope of the Sales subsystem includes in-store, online, \nand telephone sales processes. A customer can also be associated with an online \nshopping cart (OnLineCart) for any online sale. There are two special types \nof carts: the active cart and the on-reserve cart. The minimum multiplicity \nbetween customer and cart is zero, meaning there might not be a shopping cart \ninvolved\u2014for example, in an in-store or telephone sale. There can be a maxi-\nmum of two carts for a customer at any one time: an active cart and an on-\nreserve cart. The on-reserve cart can be remembered from session to session. \nEach sale and each cart is associated with one customer, so the subclasses inherit \nthe association, just as they inherit the attributes of Sale.\nNote that an individual sale is associated with one or more sale items. In the \nonline cart, it is associated with one or more cart items. With an online sale, the \nsale is created from the cart when the customer checks out. Sale items are cre-\nated from each cart item. Finally, a sales transaction is created and associated \nwith the sale.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Each product item might have many accessories, and an accessory \nmight apply to many product items. Here, there is no defined association class \nfor the many-to-many association.

{"text": "114\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nfor a customer, all sales and sales transactions need to be referenced. Repeat-\ning domain classes in several subsystems does not mean there is redundancy. In \ncomplex domain models, it is easier to do the modeling and analysis in separate \ndiagrams before merging them all together. Sometimes, the project team divides \nthe work by subsystem, so each would work on a separate diagram being sure to \ncoordinate with each other.\nThe Customer Account subsystem includes messages, partner credits, and \nfriend links. The FriendLink class is an association class, but unlike other exam-\nples, it is attached to a unary association between customers. Each customer can \nbe linked to many other customers, shown by the association line at the top of the \nCustomer class. For each link, the status and dateLinkedUp is stored. The Mes-\nsage class is handled differently. Each customer can send many messages, each to \nmany other customers. Similarly, each customer can receive many messages.\n\u275a\n\u275aThe Complete RMO Domain Model Class Diagram\nThe analysts at RMO may continue to model each subsystem separately. The \nexercises at the end of this chapter ask you to create those other subsystem dia-\ngrams. The final domain model class diagram for the RMO CSMS is shown in \nFigure 4-25. Classes not shown before include Shipper, Shipment, ReturnItem, \nand Suggestion. You should spend some time to understand all of the classes and \nassociations in this model. Real-world domain model class diagrams are often \nmuch more complex than this example.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The State Machine Diagram\u2014Identifying \nObject\u00a0Behavior\nSometimes, it is important for a computer system to maintain information about \nthe status of problem domain objects. For example, a customer might want to know \nwhether a particular sale has been shipped or a manager might want to know if a \ncustomer sale has been paid for. Thus, the system needs to be able to track the sta-\ntus of customer sales. When defining requirements, analysts need to identify and \ndocument which domain objects require status checking and which business rules \ndetermine valid status conditions. Referring back to RMO, an example of a busi-\nness rule is that a customer sale shouldn\u2019t be shipped until it has been paid for.\nThe status condition for a real-world object is often referred to as the state \nof the object. Defined precisely, a state of an object is a condition that occurs \nduring its life when it satisfies some criterion, performs some action, or waits for \nan event. For real-world objects, we mean the same thing whether we refer to \nthe status condition of an object or talk about its state.\nThe naming convention for status conditions helps identify valid states. \nA\u00a0state might have a name of a simple condition, such as On or In repair. Other \nstates are more active, with names consisting of gerunds or verb phrases, such as \nBeing shipped or Working. For example, a specific Sale object comes into exis-\ntence when a customer buys something. Right after it is created, the object might \nbe in a state called Adding new sale items, then a state called Waiting for items \nto be shipped, and finally, when all items have been shipped, a state called Com-\npleted. If you find yourself trying to use a noun to name a state, you probably have \nan incorrect idea about states or object classes. The name of a state should not be \na noun (which is an object); it should be something that describes the object.\nStates are described as semipermanent conditions because external events \ncan interrupt a state and cause the object to go to a new state. An object remains \nin a state until some event causes it to move, or transition, to another state. \nA\u00a0transition, then, is the movement of an object from one state to another state. \nTransitioning is the mechanism that causes an object to leave a state and change \nto a new state. States are semipermanent because transitions interrupt them and \nstate\u2003 a condition during an object\u2019s life \nwhen it satisfies some criterion, performs \nsome action, or waits for an event\ntransition\u2003 the movement of an object from \none state to another state\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The combination of states and transi-\ntions between states provides the mechanisms that analysts use to capture busi-\nness rules. In the previous RMO example, you would say that a customer sale \nmust be in a Paid for state before it can transition to a Shipped state.\nThe UML diagram that is used to describe the behavior of an object is \ncalled a state machine diagram. Sometimes these diagrams are also called \nstate-transition diagrams because they describe the states and the transitions of \nthe object. This section introduces state machines.\nA state machine diagram describes the behavior, or the possible behav-\nior, of the objects in one particular object class. This is an important concept \nto \u00ad\nunderstand\u2014that a state machine diagram applies to only one single class, \nand that it can be used to describe the behavior of all objects within that class. \n\u00ad\nEarlier in the chapter, you learned how to create a UML class diagram. A class \ndiagram describes the static characteristics of objects and their associations. \nA\u00a0state machine describes the dynamic behavior of objects.\nA state machine diagram can be developed for any problem domain classes \nthat have complex behavior or status conditions that need to be tracked. How-\never, not all classes will require a state machine diagram. If an object in the \nproblem domain class doesn\u2019t have status conditions that must control the \nprocessing for that object, a state machine diagram probably is not necessary. \nFor example, in the RMO class diagram, a class such as Sale may need a state \nmachine diagram. However, a class such as SaleTransaction probably does not. \nA sale transaction is created when the payment is made and then just sits there; \nit doesn\u2019t need to track other conditions.\nA state machine diagram is composed of rounded rectangles representing the \nstates of an object and arrows representing the transitions. Figure 4-26 illus-\ntrates a simple state machine diagram for a printer. Because it is a little easier to \nlearn about state machine diagrams by using tangible items, let\u2019s start with a few \nexamples of computer hardware. The starting point of a state machine diagram is \na black dot, which is called a pseudostate. The first shape after the black dot is \nthe first state of the printer. In this case, the printer begins in the\u00a0Off state.\nAs shown in Figure 4-26, the arrow leaving the Off state is called a transition. \nThe firing of the transition causes the object to leave the Off state and make a \ntransition to the On state. After a transition begins, it runs to completion by taking \nthe object to the new state, called the destination state. A\u00a0transition begins with \nan arrow from an origin state\u2014the state prior to the transition\u2014to a destination \nstate, and it is labeled with a string to describe the components of the transition.\nOff\nOn\nonButtonPushed [safety cover closed] / run start-up\nA State indicates a state of\nbeing of the object.

{"text": "117\nCHAPTER 4 \u25a0 Domain Modeling\nThe transition label consists of the following syntax with three components:\ntransition-name (parameters, \u2026) [guard-condition] / action-expression\nIn Figure 4-26, the transition-name is onButtonPushed. The transition is like \na trigger that fires or an event that occurs. The name should reflect the action of \na triggering event. In Figure 4-26, no parameters are being sent to the printer so \nthe parentheses are left off. The guard-condition is [Safety cover closed]. For the \ntransition to fire, the guard must be true. The forward slash divides the firing \nmechanism from the actions or processes. Action-\u00ad\nexpressions indicate some \nprocess that must occur before the transition is completed and the object arrives \nin the destination state. In this case, the printer will run a start-up procedure \nbefore it goes into the On state.\nThe guard-condition is a qualifier or test on the transition, and it is simply \na true/false condition that must be satisfied before the transition can fire. For a \ntransition to fire, first the trigger must occur and then the guard must evaluate \nto true. Sometimes, a transition has only a guard-condition and no triggering \nevent. In that case, the trigger is considered to be constantly firing, and when-\never the guard becomes true, the transition occurs.\nAny of the three components\u2014transition-name, guard-condition, or action-\nexpression\u2014may be empty. If either the transition-name or the guard-condition \nis empty, it automatically evaluates to true. Either of them may also be complex, \nwith AND and OR connectives.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Concurrency and Concurrent States\nSometimes an object will be in two states at the same time. For example, when \nthe printer is in the On state, it can also be either Printing or Idle. There are sev-\neral ways to express this concurrent condition. This section explains the basic \napproach to modeling concurrent behavior. There are more sophisticated tech-\nniques that are available; however, the basic approach is usually sufficient for \nbusiness modeling.\nThis condition of being in more than one state at a time is called \u00ad\nconcurrency, \nor concurrent states. For example, the printer can be in the On state and the \nIdle state at the same time. Hence, On and Idle would be concurrent states. \nAnother concept that is important is the idea of a path for the object. A path \nis a sequential set of connected states and transitions. In Figure 4-26, there is \nonly one path. It is the path from the beginning state, to the On state then to \nthe Off state, and finally looping back to the On state. Sometimes within a state \nmachine diagram there will be states that are exactly concurrent states. How-\never, when there are several states in a path that are parallel to another state, we \nsay that those are concurrent paths.

{"text": "118\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nThe notation used in Figure 4-27 is similar to the notation that you used \nwith activity diagrams in Chapter 2. When a state has two transitions that exit \nthat state, it is considered an OR condition. In other words, the path for the \nobject follows only one of the transitions. To show parallel paths with the object \nfollowing both paths, that is, an AND condition, a synchronization bar is used.\nIn Figure 4-27, the path with the Idle and Printing states is parallel with the \npath with the On state. In other words, the printer will be in either the Idle or \nPrinting states whenever it is in the On state. Notice that the printRequest (doc) \ntransition does have an argument being sent with the transition. The printer will \ncycle between the Idle state and the Printing state whenever it is in the On state. \nWhen the offButtonPushed transition fires, the printer exits both the On state \nand either the Idle or Printing state, whichever is active. Now that you know the \nbasic notation of state machine diagrams, you will learn how to develop a state \nmachine diagram.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Rules for Developing State Machine Diagrams\nState machine diagram development follows a set of rules. Usually, the primary \nchallenge in building a state machine diagram is to identify the right states for \nthe object. It might be helpful to pretend that you are the object itself. It is easy to \npretend to be a customer, but it\u2019s a little more difficult to say \u201cI am an order\u201d or \u201cI \nam a shipment. How do I come into existence? What states am I in?\u201d However, if \nyou can begin to think this way, it will help you develop state machine diagrams.\nA good approach is to remember that developing state machine diagrams is \nan iterative behavior\u2014more so than developing any other type of diagram. Ana-\nlysts seldom get a state machine diagram right the first time. They always draw \nit and then refine it again and again.\nFinally, don\u2019t forget to ask about an exception condition\u2014especially when \nyou see the words verify or check. Usually, there will be two transitions out of \nstates that verify something: one for acceptance and one for rejection.\nHere is a list of steps that will help you get started in developing state \nmachine diagrams:\n1.\t Review the class diagram and select the classes that might require state \nmachine diagrams. Only include those classes that have multiple status \nconditions that are important for the system to track. Then, begin with the \nclasses that appear to have the simplest state machine diagrams, such as the \nSaleItem class for RMO.\n2.\t For each selected class in the group, make a list of all the status condi-\ntions you can identify. At this point, simply brainstorm. Remember that \nthese states must reflect the states for the real-world objects that will be \nrepresented in software. Sometimes, it is helpful to think of the physical \nobject, identify states of the physical object, and then translate those that \nare appropriate into corresponding system states or status conditions. It \nis also helpful to think of the life of the object. Think of activities done to \nthe object or by the object. Often, the object will be in a particular state as \nthese actions are occurring.\n3.\t Begin building state machine diagram fragments by identifying the transi-\ntions that cause an object to leave the identified state. For example, if a sale \nis in a state of Ready to be shipped, a transition such as beginShipping will \ncause the sale to leave that state.\n4.\t Sequence these state-transition fragments in the correct order. Then, aggre-\ngate these combinations into larger fragments. As the fragments are being \naggregated into larger paths, it is natural to begin to look for a natural life \ncycle for the object.\n5.\t Review the paths and look for independent, concurrent paths. When an \nitem can be in two states concurrently, there are probably one or more \nconcurrent paths.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "119\nCHAPTER 4 \u25a0 Domain Modeling\n6.\t Look for additional transitions. Often, during a first iteration, several of the \npossible combinations of state-transition-state are missed. One method to \nidentify them is to take every paired combination of states and ask whether \nthere is a valid transition between the states. Test for transitions in both directions.\n7.\t Expand each transition with the appropriate message event, guard-\ncondition, and action-expression. Include with each state appropriate \naction-expressions.\n8.\t Review and test each state machine diagram. Review each of your state \nmachine diagrams to make sure the names of the states describe the object\u2019s \nstatus condition, to make sure you have identified all the transitions, to check \nfor all concurrent paths, and to ensure you have the exception conditions.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Developing RMO State Machine Diagrams\nLet us practice these steps by developing two state machine diagrams for RMO. \nThe first step is to review the domain class diagram and then select the classes \nthat may have status conditions that need to be tracked. In this case, we select \nthe SaleItem and the InventoryItem classes. Other classes that are candidates for \nstate machine diagrams are: Sale, to track when it is completed; Shipment, to \ntrack arrivals at the customer location; and possibly Customer, to track active \nand inactive customers.\n\u275a\n\u275aDeveloping the SaleItem State Machine Diagram\nThe first step in developing the SaleItem state machine diagram is to identify the \npossible status conditions that might be of interest. Some necessary status condi-\ntions are Ready to be shipped, On back order, and Shipped. An interesting ques-\ntion comes to mind at this point: Can a sale item be partially shipped? In other \nwords, if the customer bought 10 of a single item but there are only five in inven-\ntory, should RMO ship those five and put the other five on back order? You \nshould see the ramifications of this decision. The system and the database would \nneed to be designed to track and monitor detailed information to support this \ncapability. The domain class diagram for RMO indicates that a SaleItem can be \nassociated with either zero (not yet shipped) shipments or one (totally shipped) \nshipment. Based on the current specification, the definition doesn\u2019t allow partial \nshipments of SaleItems.\nThis is just another example of the benefit of building models. Had we not \nbeen developing the state machine diagram model, this question might never \nhave been asked. The development of detailed models and diagrams is one of the \nmost important activities that a system developer can perform. It forces analysts \nto ask fundamental questions. Sometimes, new system developers think that \nmodel development is a waste of time, especially for small systems. However, \ntruly understanding the users\u2019 needs before writing the program always saves \ntime in the long run.\nThe second step is to identify exit transitions for each of the status conditions. \nFigure 4-28 is a table showing the states that have been defined and the exit tran-\nsitions for each of those states. One additional state has been added to the list\u2014\nOpen\u2014which covers the condition that occurs when an item has been added to \nthe sale but the sale isn\u2019t complete or paid for, so the item isn\u2019t ready for shipping.\nState\nTransition causing exit\nOpen\nsaleComplete\nOn back order\nitemArrived\nReady to Ship\nshipItem\nShipped\nNo exit transition defined\nFigure 4-28 States and exit \ntransitions for SaleItem object\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "120\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nThe third step is to combine the state-transition pairs into fragments \nand to build a state machine diagram with the states in the correct sequence. \nFigure 4-29 illustrates the partially completed state machine diagram. The flow \nfrom beginning to end for the SaleItem object is quite obvious. However, at least \none transition seems to be missing. There should be some path to allow entry \ninto the On back order state so we recognize that this first-cut state machine \ndiagram needs some refinement. We will fix that in a moment.\nThe fourth step is to look for concurrent paths. In this case, it doesn\u2019t appear \nthat a SaleItem object can be in any two of the identified states at the same time. \nOf course, because we chose to begin with a simple state machine diagram, that \nwas expected.\nThe fifth step is to look for additional transitions. This step is where we \nflesh out other necessary transitions. The first addition is to have a transition \nfrom Open to On back order. To continue, examine every pair of states to see \nwhether there are other possible combinations. In particular, look for backward \ntransitions. In this situation, we will not define any backward transitions.\nThe sixth step is to complete all the transitions with correct names, guard-\nconditions, and action-expressions. Two new transition-names are added. The \nfirst is the transition from the beginning black dot to the Open state. That \ntransition causes the creation\u2014or, in system terms, the instantiation\u2014of a new \nSaleItem object. It is given the same name as the message into the system that \nadds it: addItem. The final transition is the one that causes the order item to \nbe removed from the system. This transition goes from the Shipped state to a \nfinal circled black dot, which is a final pseudostate. On the assumption that \nit is archived to a backup tape when it is deleted from the active system, that \ntransition is named archive. The seventh step\u2014reviewing and testing the state \nmachine diagram\u2014is the quality-review step.

{"text": "121\nCHAPTER 4 \u25a0 Domain Modeling\n\u275a\n\u275aDeveloping the InventoryItem State Machine Diagram\nAn InventoryItem will have a slightly more complex state machine. In this exam-\nple, you will discover the need to have some concurrent paths defined. As before, \nstart by thinking of the various status conditions that are important and their asso-\nciated end or exit conditions. As you think about an inventory item, recognize that \nimportant status conditions are associated with the level of inventory. An item can \nbe at a normal inventory level, a low inventory level, or completely out of stock. In \naddition, an inventory item can be on order or have an order outstanding. It could \nalso not have any orders outstanding. As you think about it, notice that it appears \nthese two sets of status are independent of each other. First, identify all of these \nstates and their exit transitions. Figure 4-31 documents our thinking.\nIn the third and fourth steps, you combine these states and transitions into \nfragments and connect them together to give the first-cut state machine dia-\ngram. In the fifth step, you see if these state-transition fragments are really con-\ncurrent paths. In this situation, there are two concurrent paths. Figure 4-32 \nshows these steps.\nThere are a few things you need to consider with this first-cut state machine. \nLet\u2019s look at the various transitions and consider each transition along with its \norigin state and destination state. The top path appears to be okay\u2014cycling \nbetween Not on order and On order. In the bottom path, however, there are \ntransitions that have the same name. How do you ensure that the correct transi-\ntions fire and the correct states are used?\nFirst consider the reduceInventory transition. The InventoryItem will \nreceive this message every time an item is sold. However, it only wants to take \nthe transition from one state to another if it is at the reorder point, or if it is the \nlast item in stock. Let\u2019s add guards to define those conditions. You also want to \ninitiate a reorder process when the InventoryItem goes to a Low stock or a Zero \nstock state. Let\u2019s add those action expressions.\nNext consider the restock transition. It is correct. Depending on what state \nthe InventoryItem is in, the correct transition will fire and move to the Normal \nstock state.\nState\nTransition causing exit\nNormal stock\nreduceInventory\nZero stock\nremoveItem OR restock\nLow stock\nreduceInventory OR restock\nOn order\nitemArrives\nNot on order\norderItem\nFigure 4-31 States and exit \ntransitions for InventoryItem object\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\norderItem\nOn order\nNot on order\nreduceInventory\nrestock\nrestock\nLow stock\nNormal stock\nreduceInventory\nZero stock\nitemArrives\nFigure 4-32 First-cut state \nmachine diagram for InventoryItem \nobject\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

UML and the domain model \nclass diagram can be extended to include three types of \nrelationships: association relationships, generalization/\nspecialization relationships (inheritance), and whole-\npart relationships. Additional concepts of importance \nin domain model class diagrams are superclasses, \nsubclasses, abstract classes, and concrete classes. The \nbehavior of problem domain objects is an aspect of \nfunctional requirements that is also studied and mod-\neled. Over time, an object will transition from one state \nto another. The UML state machine diagram is used to \nmodel object states and state transitions. Only complex \ndomain classes with numerous states and state transi-\ntions will warrant a state machine diagram. Up to this \npoint, when we talk about domain classes, they are \nconceptual things that users work with; they are not \nsoftware classes. During design, many domain classes \nwill become software classes and will also become \n\u00ad\ntables in the relational database.\nThis is the second of three chapters that present tech-\nniques for modeling a system\u2019s functional require-\nments, highlighting the tasks that are completed during \nthe analysis activity Define requirements. Use cases \nand things in the user\u2019s work environment are key \nconcepts common to all approaches to system develop-\nment. This chapter discusses data entities and domain \nclasses as two terms for things in the work environ-\nment. Two techniques are demonstrated for identifying \nthings in\u00a0the problem domain: the brainstorming tech-\nnique and the noun technique. The entity-\u00ad\nrelationship \ndiagram (ERD) is used by traditional analysts and \nby database analysts to model things in the problem \ndomain. An ERD shows data entities, attributes, and \nrelationships. The UML class diagram is used for the \nsame purpose by analysts using UML, referred to as the \ndomain model class diagram. The domain model class \ndiagram models domain classes, attributes, and associ-\nations. Multiplicity refers to the number of association \nChapter Summary\nThe other thing you need to add is a starting initial state and a final state. \nLet\u2019s define transitions to createItem for the beginning and deleteItem for the \nend. DeleteItem is when it is removed completely from the system and the data-\nbase. In other words, it is no longer offered for sale. Figure 4-33 presents the \nfinal state machine diagram for the InventoryItem object class.\nAs noted by these examples, the benefit of developing a state machine dia-\ngram for a problem domain object is that it helps you capture and clarify busi-\nness rules. As you develop the state machine diagrams, you must think more \ndeeply about the behavior of these objects and what kind of conditions need to \nbe accounted for in the program code. As always, the benefits of careful model \nbuilding help you gain a true understanding of the system requirements.\nFigure 4-33 Final state machine diagram for InventoryItem object\norderItem\ncreateItem\ndeleteItem\nOn order\nNot on order\nreduceInventory\n[at reorder point]\n/reorder\nrestock\nrestock\nLow stock\nNormal stock\nreduceInventory\n[at last Item]\n/reorder\nZero stock\nitemArrives\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "128\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nOn the Spot Courier Services\nOn the Spot courier services grew and changed over \nthe years. At first, Bill received requests for package \npickups on his mobile phone, recorded that informa-\ntion in a log, and would then drive around to retrieve \nall the packages later in the day. However, he soon \ndiscovered that with another driver, it was difficult \nto coordinate pickups between the two of them from \nhis van. It was not long before he reorganized his \nbusiness and turned the warehouse employee into a \ndriver. Then, he stayed in the warehouse himself, and \nhis two employees made all the pickups and deliver-\nies. This worked well because he could control and \ncoordinate the pickups and deliveries better. It was \nalso easier for him to receive pickup requests working \nat a desk rather than trying to do it while driving a \ndelivery van.\nAs he thought about how his business was grow-\ning and the services he provided to his customers, Bill \nbegan to itemize the kinds of information he would \nneed to maintain.\nOf course, he needed to maintain information \nabout his customers. Some of his customers were \nbusinesses; some were individuals. He needed to have \nbasic address and contact information for every cus-\ntomer. Also, for his corporate customers, he needed to \nidentify a primary contact person. It was mostly his \ncorporate customers who wanted to receive monthly \nstatements listing all their shipments during the month \nand the total cost. Bill needed to distinguish which \ncustomers paid cash and which wanted monthly state-\nments. In fact, for those who paid monthly, he needed \nto keep a running account of such things as when they \nwere last billed, when they paid, and any outstanding \nbalances. Finally, when payments were received, either \nfor individual shipments or from monthly invoices, \nhe needed to record information about the payment: \ntype of payment, date, and amount. Although this was \nnot a sophisticated billing and payment system, Bill \nthought it would suffice for his needs.\nNext, he started thinking about his packages and \nshipments. At the time that a request for a pickup \ncame in, he needed to keep track of it as some type \nof delivery request or delivery order. At that point in \ntime, Bill mostly needed to know who the customer \nwas, where the pickup location was, and what date \nand time the package(s) would be ready for pickup. He \nalso recorded the date and time that he received the \norder. A delivery order was considered \u201copen\u201d until \nthe delivery van arrived at the pickup location and the \npackages were all retrieved. At that point, the delivery \norder was satisfied.\nOnce the packages were retrieved, each pack-\nage needed to be uniquely identified. Bill needed to \nknow when it was picked up and which delivery per-\nson picked it up. Other important information was \nthe \u201cdeliver to\u201d entity name and the address. He also \nneeded to identify the type of delivery. Some pack-\nages were high priority, requiring same-day delivery. \nOthers were overnight. Of course, the weight and cost \nwere recorded so the customer could either pay or have \nit added to the monthly invoice.\nIn the courier and delivery business, one of the \nmost important information requirements is the date \nand time stamp. For each package, it is important to \nknow when it was picked up, when it arrived at the \nwarehouse, when it went back out on the delivery \nrun, and when it was delivered. When possible, it is \nalso important to have names associated with each of \nthese\u00a0events.\n\t\n1.\tUsing the noun technique, read through this case \nand identify all the nouns that may be important \nfor this system.

{"text": "132\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Overview\nThe main objective of defining requirements in system development is under-\nstanding users\u2019 needs, how the business processes are carried out, and how \nthe system will be used to support those business processes. As indicated in \nChapter\u00a02, system developers use a set of models to discover and understand the \nrequirements for a new system. This activity is a key part of systems analysis in \nthe system development process. The first step in the process for developing this \nunderstanding requires the fact-finding skills you learned in Chapter 2. Fact-\nfinding activities are also called discovery activities, and obviously, discovery \nmust precede understanding.\nThe models introduced in Chapters 3 and 4 focus on two primary aspects of \nfunctional requirements: the use cases and the problem domain classes involved \nin users\u2019 work. User stories are sometimes used in place of use cases with Agile \ndevelopment. Use cases are identified by using the user goal technique and the \nOpening case\u2002 Electronics Unlimited: Integrating the Supply Chain\nElectronics Unlimited is a warehousing distributor that \nbuys electronic equipment from various suppliers and \nsells it to retailers throughout the United States and \nCanada. It has operations and warehouses in Los Ange-\nles, Houston, Baltimore, Atlanta, New York, Denver, and \nMinneapolis. Its customers range from large nationwide \nretailers, such as Target, to medium-sized independent \nelectronics stores.\nMost large retailers have moved toward integrated \nsupply chains. Information systems used to be focused \non processing internal data; however, today, these retail \nchains want suppliers to become part of a totally inte-\ngrated supply chain system. In other words, the systems \nneed to communicate between companies to make the \nsupply chain more efficient.\nTo maintain its position as a leading wholesale dis-\ntributor, Electronics Unlimited has to convert its system to \nlink with its suppliers (the manufacturers of the electronic \nequipment) and its customers (the retailers). It is develop-\ning a completely new system that uses object-oriented \ntechniques to provide these links. Object-oriented tech-\nniques facilitate system-to-system interfaces by using \npredefined components and objects to accelerate the \ndevelopment process. Fortunately, many of the system \ndevelopment staff members have experience with object-\noriented development and are eager to apply the tech-\nniques and models to the system development project.\nWilliam Jones is explaining object-oriented develop-\nment to the group of systems analysts who are being \ntrained in this approach.\n\u201cWe\u2019re developing most of our new systems by \nusing object-oriented principles,\u201d he tells them. \u201cThe \ncomplexity of the new system, along with its interactiv-\nity, makes the object-oriented approach a natural way to \ndevelop requirements. The object-oriented models track \nvery closely with the new object-oriented programming \nlanguages and frameworks.\u201d\nWilliam is just getting warmed up.\n\u201cThis way of thinking about a system in terms of \nobjects is very interesting,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is also consis-\ntent with the object-oriented programming techniques \nyou learned in your programming classes. You prob-\nably first learned to think about objects when you de-\nveloped screens for the user interface. All the controls \non the screen, such as buttons, text boxes, and drop-\ndown boxes, are objects. Each has its own set of trigger \nevents that activate its program functions.\u201d\n\u201cHow does this apply to our situation?\u201d one of the \nanalysts asks.\n\u201cYou just extend that thought process,\u201d William \nexplains.\u201d You think of such things as purchase orders \nand employees as objects, too. We can call them the \nproblem domain objects to differentiate them from user-\ninterface objects, such as windows and buttons. During \nanalysis, we have to find out all the trigger events and \nmethods associated with each business object.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how do we do that?\u201d another analyst asks.\n\u201cYou continue with your fact-finding activities and \nbuild a better understanding of each use case,\u201d William \nsays. \u201cThe way the problem domain objects interact \nwith each other in the use case determines how you \nidentify the initiating activity. We refer to those activi-\nties as the messages between objects. The tricky part \nis that you need to think in terms of objects instead of \njust processes. Sometimes, it helps me to pretend I am \nan object. I will say, \u2018I am a purchase order object. What \nfunctions and services are other objects going to ask me \nto do?\u2019 After you get the hang of it, it works very well, \nand it is enlightening to see how the system require-\nments unfold as you develop the diagrams.\u201d\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "133\nCHAPTER 5 \u25a0 Use Case Modeling\nevent decomposition technique. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) use \ncase diagram was introduced to show use cases and actors. An information sys-\ntem also needs to record and store information about classes of objects involved \nin the business processes. In a manual system, the information is recorded on \npaper and stored in a filing cabinet. In an automated system, the information is \nstored in electronic files or a database. The information storage requirements of \na system are documented either with entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) or, as \nemphasized in this text, with UML domain model class diagrams.\nIn this chapter, you learn additional techniques and models that will allow \nyou to extend the requirements models to show additional information about \nthe use cases for the system. Fully developed use case descriptions, UML activ-\nity diagrams, and UML system sequence diagrams (SSDs) are introduced to \nshow more information about each use case. Additionally, the CRUD technique \nis introduced to help validate the use cases in terms of supporting all of the \ndomain classes in the domain model class diagram. Remember, when defining \nrequirements for a system, you will also be doing design and implementation \nwork, as illustrated in the Trade Show application developed in Chapter 1.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Use Case Descriptions\nA list of use cases and use case diagrams provides an overview of all the use \ncases for a system. Detailed information about each use case is described \nwith a use case description. Brief use case descriptions were introduced in \nChapter\u00a03. This chapter introduces fully developed use case descriptions that list \nand describe the processing details for a use case.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Brief Use Case Descriptions\nDepending on an analyst\u2019s needs, use case descriptions tend to be written at \ntwo separate levels of detail: brief description and fully developed description. \nSome brief use case descriptions were shown in Chapter 3 (repeated again as \nFigure 5-1). A brief description gives enough detail for very simple use cases, \nespecially when the system to be developed is a small, well-understood applica-\ntion. Examples of simple use cases are Add product comment or Send message. \nA use case such as Fill shopping cart is complex enough that a fully developed \ndescription is also written after the initial brief use case description is finalized.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Fully Developed Use Case Descriptions\nThe fully developed description is the most formal method for documenting a \nuse case. One of the major difficulties for software developers is that they often \nstruggle to obtain a deep understanding of the users\u2019 needs. But if you create a \nfully developed use case description, you increase the probability that you thor-\noughly understand the business processes and the ways the system must support \nthem. To create a comprehensive, robust system that truly meets users\u2019 needs, \nuse case description \u2003 a textual model \nthat lists and describes the processing details \nfor a use case\nUse case \nCreate customer account\nLook up customer\nProcess account adjustment\nBrief use case description \nUser/actor enters new customer account data, and the system\nassigns account number, creates a customer record, and \ncreates an account record.\nUser/actor enters customer account number, and the system\nretrieves and displays customer and account data.\nUser/actor enters order number, and the system retrieves \ncustomer and order data; actor enters adjustment amount, and\nthe system creates a transaction record for the adjustment.\nFigure 5-1 Use cases and brief \nuse case descriptions\n\u00a9 CengageLearning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Internally, a use case \nincludes a whole sequence of steps to complete a business process. Figure 5-2 \nis an example of a fully developed use case description of the use case Create \ncustomer account.\nFigure 5-2 also serves as a standard template for documenting a fully \ndeveloped description for other use cases. The first and second compartments \nare used to identify the use case and the specific scenario within the use case \n(if\u00a0needed) that is being documented. Frequently, several variations of the busi-\nness steps exist within a single use case. These different flows of activities are \ncalled scenarios or sometimes use case instances.

Thus, a scenario is a unique set of inter-\nnal activities within a use case and represents a unique path through the use case.\nIn larger or more formal projects, a unique identifier can also be added for \nthe use case, with an extension identifying the particular scenario. Sometimes, \nthe name of the system developer who produced the form is added.\nThe third compartment identifies the event that triggers the use case. The \nfourth compartment is a brief description of the use case. Analysts may just \nduplicate the brief description they constructed earlier here. The fifth compart-\nment identifies the actor or actors. Implied in all use cases is a person who uses \nthe system called an actor. Actors are shown as stick figures on use case dia-\ngrams. An actor is always outside the automation boundary of the system but \nmay be part of the manual portion of the system. By defining actors that way\u2014\nas those who interact with the automated part of the system\u2014you can more pre-\ncisely define the exact interactions to which the automated system must respond.\nThe sixth compartment identifies other use cases and the way they are \nrelated to this use case. These cross-references to other use cases help document \nall aspects of the users\u2019 requirements.\nThe seventh compartment identifies stakeholders who are interested parties \nother than specific actors. They might be users who don\u2019t actually invoke the \nuse case but who have an interest in results produced from the use case. For \nexample, in Figure 5-2, the Accounting Department is interested in accurately \ncapturing billing and credit card information. Although no one in the Market-\ning Department actually creates new customer accounts, they do perform sta-\ntistical analysis of the new customers and create marketing promotions. Thus, \nmarketers have an interest in the data that are captured and stored from the \nCreate customer account use case. The Sales Department is interested in having \nan easy-to-use and attractive user interface to ensure sales aren\u2019t lost because of \npoor user experience. Considering all the stakeholders is important for system \ndevelopers so they ensure they have understood all requirements.\nThe eighth and ninth compartments\u2014preconditions and postconditions\u2014\nprovide critical information about the state of the system before and after the \nuse case executes. Preconditions identify what the state of the system must be \nfor the use case to begin, including what objects must already exist, what infor-\nmation must be available, and even the condition of the actor prior to beginning \nthe use case.\nPostconditions identify what must be true upon completion of the use \ncase. Most important, they indicate what new objects are created or updated \nby the use case and how objects need to be associated. The postconditions are \nimportant for two reasons. First, they form the basis for stating the expected \nresults for test cases that will be used for testing the use case after it is imple-\nmented. For example, in the Create customer account use case, it is important \nto test that a customer record, address record, and account record were suc-\ncessfully added to the database. Second, the objects in postconditions indicate \nwhich objects involved in the use case are important for design. You will see in \nChapters 12 and 13 that the design of a use case includes identifying and assign-\ning responsibilities to objects that collaborate to complete the use case. In this \nsituation, a customer, one or more addresses, and an account object collaborate \nto create a new customer account.\nThe tenth compartment in the template describes the detailed flow of activi-\nties of the use case. In this instance, Figure 5-2 shows a two-column version, \nidentifying the steps performed by the actor and the responses required by the \nsystem. The item numbers help identify the sequence of the steps. Alternative \nactivities and exception conditions are described in the eleventh compartment. \nThe numbering of exception conditions also helps tie the exceptions to specific \nsteps in the flow of activities.\npreconditions\u2003 conditions that must be \ntrue before a use case begins\npostconditions\u2003 what must be true upon \nthe successful completion of a use case\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Some analysts put that detail in, but others don\u2019t because the \nemphasis is on the interaction with the automated part of the application. In this \nuse case, the preconditions show what existing objects must already exist before \nthe use case can execute.

{"text": "137\nCHAPTER 5 \u25a0 Use Case Modeling\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Activity Diagrams for Use Cases\nAnother way to document a use case is with a UML activity diagram. In \nChapter\u00a02, you learned about activity diagrams as a form of workflow diagram \nthat might cover several use cases. Activity diagrams are also used to document \nthe flow of activities for one use case.\nFigure 5-4 is an activity diagram that documents the flow of activities for \nthe Create customer account use case. Sometimes, an activity diagram can take \nthe place of the flow of activities section of a use case description, and some-\ntimes, it is created to supplement the use case description. In this example, there \nare two swimlanes: one for the customer and one for the system. The customer \nhas three activities, and the system has five activities.\nAn example is shown in Figure 5-5 for the Ship items use case previ-\nously seen in Figure 5-3. One of the strengths of activity diagrams is that it \nprovides a more graphical view of the flow of activities. Figure 5-5 illustrates \nboth a repeating set of steps, that is for each SaleItem in the Sale, and a deci-\nsion point to choose which set of steps to perform. Even though this flow is \ndescribed by the use case description, it is more evident in the activity dia-\ngram.

In this example, we see a loop and inside the loop a decision \npoint to initiate independent paths, which are later rejoined at the ending \nsynchronization bar.\nActivity diagrams are helpful when the flow of activities for a use case is \ncomplex. The use case Fill shopping cart is complex in that three other use \ncases might be invoked while adding items to the shopping cart. For example, \nthe actor might search for a product and then look at product reviews before \nadding the item to the cart. Once an item is added, the actor might search for \nand view available accessories and then add one or more to the cart. The activ-\nity diagram shown in Figure 5-6 shows the Fill shopping cart use case flow \nof activities. The shaded ovals show the other use cases that are invoked while \nfilling the shopping cart. The activities of Fill shopping cart go in between the \nother use cases. For example, after invoking Search for product and then Look \nat product reviews, the actor might start Fill shopping cart to select options \nand quantities and add it to the cart. Then the actor might switch to Search and \nview accessories before continuing Fill shopping cart to add an accessory.

{"text": "140\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\n\u25a0\n\u25a0SSD Notation\nFigure 5-7 shows a generic SSD with callouts annotating the diagram. As with \na use case diagram, the stick figure represents an actor\u2014a person (or role) who \ninteracts with the system. In a use case diagram, the actor \u201cuses\u201d the system, \nbut the emphasis in an SSD is on how the actor \u201cinteracts\u201d with the system by \nentering input data and receiving output data. The box labeled :System is an \nobject that represents the entire automated system. In SSDs and all other inter-\naction diagrams, analysts use object notation instead of class notation. In object \nnotation, a box refers to an individual object, not the class of all similar objects. \nThe notation is simply a rectangle with the name of the object underlined. The \ncolon before the underlined class name is a frequently used but optional part of \nthe object notation to indicate that the object is an unnamed object of the class. \nIn an SSD, the only object included is one representing the entire system: an \nunnamed object of the System class.\nUnderneath the actor and :System are vertical dashed lines called lifelines. \nA\u00a0lifeline, or object lifeline, is simply the extension of that object\u2014either actor \nor object\u2014during the use case. The arrows between the lifelines represent the \nmessages that are sent by the actor. Each arrow has an origin and a destination. \nThe origin of the message is the actor or object that sends it, as indicated by the \nlifeline at the arrow\u2019s tail. Similarly, the destination actor or object of a message \nis indicated by the lifeline that is touched by the arrowhead. The purpose of \nlifelines is to indicate the sequence of the messages sent and received by the actor \nand object. The sequence of messages is read from top to bottom in the diagram.\nA message is labeled to describe its purpose and any input data being sent. \nThe message name should follow the verb-noun syntax to make the purpose \nclear. The syntax of the message label has several options; the simplest forms are \nshown in Figure 5-7. Remember that the arrows are used to represent a message \nand input data. But what is meant by the term message here? In a sequence dia-\ngram, a message is an action that is invoked on the destination object, much like \na command.

{"text": "141\nCHAPTER 5 \u25a0 Use Case Modeling\nThe clerk is sending a request (a message) to the system to find an item. The \ninput data that is sent with the message is contained within the parentheses, and \nin this case, it is data to identify the particular item. The syntax is simply the \nname of the message followed by the input parameters in parentheses. This form \nof syntax is attached to a solid line with arrow.\nThe returned value has a slightly different format and meaning. Notice that \nthe line with arrow is dashed. A dashed arrow indicates a response or an answer \n(in programming, a return), and as shown in the figure, it immediately follows the \ninitiating message. The format of the label is also different. Because it is a response, \nonly the data that are sent on the response are noted. There is no message request-\ning a service\u2014only the data being returned. In this case, a valid response might \nbe a list of all the information returned\u2014for example, the description, price, and \nquantity of an item. However, an abbreviated version is also satisfactory. In this \ncase, the information returned is named item information. Additional documen-\ntation is required to show the details. In Figure 5-7, this additional information is \nshown as a note. A note can be added to any UML diagram to add explanations. \nThe details of item information could also be documented in supporting narra-\ntives or even simply referenced by the attributes in the Customer class.\nFrequently, the same message is sent multiple times in a loop, as shown in \nFigure 5-8.

{"text": "142\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nto add an item to an order may be sent multiple times. Figure 5-8(a) illustrates \nthe notation to show this repeating operation. The message and its return are \nlocated inside a larger rectangle called a loop frame. In a smaller rectangle at \nthe top of the frame is the descriptive text to control the behavior of the mes-\nsages within the larger rectangle. The condition loop for all items indicates \nthat the messages in the box repeat many times or are associated with many \ninstances.\nFigure 5-8(b) shows an alternate notation. Here, the square brackets \nand text inside them are called a true/false condition for the messages. \nThe asterisk (*) preceding the true/false condition indicates that the message \nrepeats as long as the true/false condition evaluates to true. Analysts use this \nabbreviated notation for several reasons. First, a message and the returned \ndata can be shown in one step. Note that the return data is identified as a \nreturn value on the left side of an assignment operator\u2014the := sign. This alter-\nnative simply shows a value that is returned. Second, the true/false condition is \nplaced on the message itself. Note that in this example, the true/false condition \nis used for the control of the loop. True/false conditions are also used to evalu-\nate any type of test that determines whether a message is sent. For example, \nconsider the true/false condition [credit card payment]. If it is true that the \nthing being tested is a credit card payment, the message is sent to the system \nto verify a credit card number. Finally, an asterisk is placed on the message \nitself to indicate the message repeats. Thus, for simple repeating messages, \nthe alternate notation is shorter. However, if several messages are included \nwithin the repeat or there are multiple messages\u2014each with its own true/false \ncondition\u2014the loop frame is more explicit and precise.\nHere is the complete notation for a message:\n[true/false condition] return-value := message-name (parameter-list)\nAny part of the message can be omitted. In brief, the notation components \ndo the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAn asterisk (*) indicates repeating or looping of the message.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nBrackets [ ] indicate a true/false condition. This is a test for that message \nonly. If it evaluates to true, the message is sent. If it evaluates to false, the \nmessage isn\u2019t sent.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMessage-name is the description of the requested service written as a \nverb-noun.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nParameter-list (with parentheses on initiating messages and without \nparentheses on return messages) shows the data that are passed with the \nmessage.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReturn-value on the same line as the message (requires :=) is used to \ndescribe data being returned from the destination object to the source \nobject in response to the message.\nSequence diagrams also use two addition frames to depict processing logic, \nas shown in Figure 5-9. The opt frame in Figure 5-9(a) is used when a message \nor a series of messages is optional or based on some true/false condition. The alt \nframe is used with if-then-else logic, as shown in Figure 5-9(b). The alt frame in \nthis figure indicates that if an item is taxable, then add sales tax; otherwise, add \na tax exemption code for a sales tax exemption.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Developing a System Sequence Diagram (SSD)\nAn SSD is usually used in conjunction with the use case descriptions to help doc-\nument the details of a single use case or scenario within a use case.

{"text": "144\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\nThe development of an SSD based on an activity diagram falls into four steps:\n1.\t Identify the input messages. In Figure 5-4, there are three locations with a \nworkflow arrow crossing the boundary line between the customer and the \nsystem. At each location that the workflow crosses the automation bound-\nary, input data are required; therefore, a message is needed.\n2.\t Describe the message from the external actor to the system by using\u00a0the \nmessage notation described earlier. In most cases, you will need a  \nmessage name that describes the service requested from the system and \nthe input parameters being passed. Figure 5-10\u2014the SSD for the Create \n \ncustomer account use case\u2014illustrates the three messages based on \nthe activity diagram. Notice that the names of the messages reflect the \nservices that the actor is requesting of the system: createNewCustomer, \nenterAddress, and enterCreditCard. Other names could also have  \nbeen used. For example, instead of enterAddress, the name could be \ncreateAddress. The point to remember is that the message name  \nshould describe the service requested from the system and should be  \nin verb-noun form.\nThe other information required is the parameter list for each message. \nDetermining exactly which data items must be passed in is more difficult. \nIn fact, developers frequently find that determining the data parameters \nrequires several iterations before a correct, complete list is obtained. The \nimportant principle for identifying data parameters is to base it on the class \ndiagram. In other words, the appropriate attributes from the classes are \nlisted as parameters. Looking at the attributes, along with an understand-\ning of what the system needs to do, will help you find the right attributes. \nWith the first message just mentioned\u2014createNewCustomer\u2014the param-\neters should include basic information about the customer, such as name, \nphone, and e-mail address. Note that when the system creates the cus-\ntomer, it assigns a new customerId and returns it with the other customer \ninformation.\nIn the second message\u2014enterAddress\u2014parameters are needed to \nidentify the full address. Usually, that would include street address, city, \nstate, and zip code. The SSD simplifies the message to show \u201caddress\u201d as \nthe parameter.\nThe third message\u2014based on the activity diagram\u2014enters the credit \ncard information. The parameter\u2014cc-info\u2014represents the account number, \nexpiration date, and security code.\n3.\t Identify and add any special conditions on the input messages, including \niteration and true/false conditions. In this instance, the enterAddress \nmessage is repeated for each address needed for the customer. The asterisk \nsymbol in front of the message is shown.\n4.\t Identify and add the output return messages. Remember that there are two \noptions for showing return information: as a return value on the message \nitself or as a separate return message with a dashed arrow. The activity \ndiagram can provide some clues about return messages, but there is no \nstandard rule that when a transition arrow in the workflow goes from the \nsystem to an external actor that an output always occurs. In Figure 5-4, \nthere are three arrows from the System swimlane to the Customer swim-\nlane. In Figure 5-10, these are shown as return data on the dashed line for \ntwo returns and as a returned value on the same line as the message for \nenterAddress. Note that they are each named with a noun that indicates \nwhat is being returned. Sometimes, no output data are returned.\nRemember that the objective is discovery and understanding, so you should \nbe working closely with users to define exactly how the workflow proceeds and \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

This is \nan iterative process, and you will probably need to refine these diagrams several \ntimes before they accurately reflect the needs of the users.\nLet us develop an SSD for the Ship items use case that is shown as a fully devel-\noped use case description in Figure 5-3 and as an activity diagram in Figure 5-5. \nNote that the actor has five numbered steps in the flow of activities, so there will \nbe five input messages in the SSD shown in  Figure 5-11: getNextSale, setShip-\nper, recordShippedItem, initiateBackorder, and getShippingLabel. No parameter is \nneeded for getNextSale because the system will automatically return the informa-\ntion for the next sale to be shipped. The shipper is selected by the actor\u2014probably \nfrom a list on the form or page\u2014so the parameter is shipperID.\nThere is a loop frame that repeats for each sale item in the sale. Inside the \nloop frame is an alt frame that tests the whether each sale item is available to \nship. If the item can be shipped, the recordShippedItem message is sent to the \nsystem. If the item cannot be shipped because it is out of stock or perhaps dam-\naged, the initiateBackorder message is sent to the system. Finally, the getShip-\npingLabel message requires two parameters: the size of the package and the \nweight. The system uses that information, along with the shipper and address, \nto produce the shipping label and record the cost.\nThese first sections of this chapter have explained the models that are used \nin object-oriented development to specify the processing aspects of the new \n\u00ad\nsystem. The use case descriptions, as provided by written narratives or activity \ndiagrams, give the details of the internal steps within each use case. Precondi-\ntion and postcondition statements help define the context for the use case\u2014that \nis, what must exist before and after processing.

{"text": "146\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Use Cases and CRUD\nAnother important technique used to validate use cases is the CRUD technique, \nwhich involves verifying that all of the needed use cases have been identified to \nmaintain the data represented by the domain model class diagram. CRUD is an \nacronym for Create, Read or Report, Update, and Delete, and it is often introduced \nwith respect to database management. The analyst starts by looking at the types \nof data stored by the system, which are modeled as domain classes, as described \nin Chapter 4. In the RMO Tradeshow System discussed in Chapter\u00a01, the types of \ndata included Supplier, Contact, Product, and ProductPicture. In the RMO CSMS, \nthe types of data include Customer, Sale, Inventory Item, Promotion, Shipment, \nand many others. To validate and refine use cases, the analyst looks at each type \nof data and verifies that use cases have been identified that create the data, read or \nreport on the data, update the data, and delete (or archive) the data.\nThe CRUD technique is most useful when used as a cross-check along with \nthe user goal technique. Users will focus on their primary goals, and use cases \nthat update or archive data will often be overlooked. The CRUD technique \nmakes sure all possibilities are identified. Sometimes, domain classes are shared \nby a set of integrated applications. For example, RMO has a supply chain man-\nagement application that is responsible for managing inventory levels and add-\ning products. The RMO CSMS will not need to create or delete products, but it \nwill need to look up and update product information.

Figure 5-12 shows an example \nof potential use cases based on the CRUD technique for RMO Customer data.\nNote in Figure 5-12 that the analyst has not blindly added a use case to \ncreate, read/report, update, and delete instances of a customer. The CRUD tech-\nnique is best used to take already identified use cases and verify that there are \nuse cases for create, read, update, and delete as a cross-check. Create customer \naccount creates customer objects. A separate Create customer use case is not \nneeded. Update customer account is defined to archive a customer, so no sepa-\nrate Archive customer use case is required.\nAnother use of the CRUD technique is to summarize all use cases and all \ndata entities/domain classes to show the connection between use cases and data. \nIn Figure 5-13, some of the use cases are matched with domain classes by includ-\ning C, R, U, or D in the cell corresponding to the role of the use case in terms \nof data. For example, the use case Create customer account actually creates \ncustomer data and account data, so the C is included in those two cells.

{"text": "148\nPART 2 \u25a0 Systems Analysis Activities\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Integrating Requirements Models\nThe diagrams described in this chapter allow analysts to completely specify the \nsystem functional requirements by modeling details of the use cases. Because \nyou are using an iterative approach, you would only construct the diagrams \nthat are necessary for a given iteration. A complete use case diagram would be \nimportant to get an idea of the total scope of the new system. But the supporting \ndetails included in use case descriptions, activity diagrams, and system sequence \ndiagrams need only be done for use cases in the specific iteration. Again, it is \nimportant to remember that not all use cases need to be modeled in detail.\nThe domain model class diagram is a special case. Much like the entire use \ncase diagram, the domain model class diagram should be as complete as pos-\nsible for the entire system early in the project, as shown for RMO in Chapter\u00a04. \nThe number of problem domain classes for the system provides an additional \nindicator of the total scope of the system. Refinement and actual implementa-\ntion of many classes will wait for later iterations, but the domain model should \nbe fairly complete. The domain model is necessary to identify all the domain \nclasses that are required in the new system. The domain model is also used to \ndesign the\u00a0database.\nThroughout this chapter, you have seen how the construction of a dia-\ngram depends on information provided by another diagram. You have also seen \nthat the development of a new diagram often helps refine and correct a pre-\nvious diagram. You should also have noted that the development of detailed \ndiagrams is critical to gaining a thorough understanding of the user require-\nments. \u00ad\nFigure\u00a05-14 illustrates the primary relationships among the requirements \nmodels for object-oriented development. The use case diagram and other dia-\ngrams on the left are used to capture the processes of the new system. The class \ndiagram and its dependent diagrams capture information about the classes for \nthe new system. The solid arrows represent major dependencies, and the dashed \narrows show minor dependencies. The dependencies generally flow from top to \nbottom, but some arrows have two heads to illustrate that influence goes in both \ndirections.\nNote that the use case diagram and the domain model class diagram are the \nprimary models from which others draw information. You should develop those \ntwo diagrams as completely as possible. The detailed descriptions\u2014either in \nnarrative format or in activity diagrams\u2014provide important internal documen-\ntation of the use cases and must completely support the use case diagram. Such \ninternal descriptions as preconditions and postconditions use information from \nthe domain model class diagram.

Thus, the detailed descriptions, \nactivity diagrams, and system sequence diagrams must all be consistent with \nregard to the steps of a particular use case.

{"text": "149\nCHAPTER 5 \u25a0 Use Case Modeling\nThe\u00a0scope of each SSD is usually a use case or a sce-\nnario within a use case. The components of an SSD are \nthe actor\u2014the same actor identified in the use case\u2014\nand the system. The system is treated as a black box in \nthat the internal processing isn\u2019t addressed. Messages, \nwhich represent the inputs, are sent from the actor to \nthe system. Output messages are returns from the sys-\ntem to the actor. The sequence of messages is indicated \nfrom top to bottom.\nThe CRUD technique is used to validate that all \nof the use cases have been identified that are neces-\nsary to maintain the data represented by the domain \nmodel class diagram. Use cases must be identified that \ncreate, read or report, update, and delete or archive in-\nstances of all classes. Alternatively, other systems that \nmaintain the data must be identified when integrated \nsystems share the same database. All the models dis-\ncussed in this chapter are interrelated, and informa-\ntion in one model explains information in others.\nThe object-oriented approach to information systems \ndevelopment has a complete set of diagrams and tex-\ntual models that together document the user\u2019s needs \nand define the system requirements. These require-\nments are specified by using domain model class \ndiagrams and state machine diagrams to model the \ndomain classes and use case diagrams, use case de-\nscriptions or activity diagrams, and system sequence \ndiagrams (SSDs) to model the use cases.\nThe internal activities of a use case are first de-\nscribed by an internal flow of activities. It is possible \nto have several different internal flows, which repre-\nsent different scenarios of the same use case. Thus, a \nuse case may have several scenarios. These details are \ndocumented either in use case descriptions or with ac-\ntivity diagrams.\nAnother diagram that provides details of the use \ncase\u2019s processing requirements is an SSD. An SSD \ndocuments the inputs and outputs of the system. \nchapter Summary\nopt frame\npostconditions\npreconditions\nscenarios or use case instances\nsystem sequence diagram (SSD)\ntrue/false condition\nuse case description\nalt frame\nCRUD technique\nlifeline or object lifeline\nloop frame\nKey Terms\n\t\n1.\tWhat are the models that describe use cases in \nmore detail?\n\t\n2.\tWhat two UML diagrams are used to model \ndomain classes?\n\t\n3.\tWhich part of a use case description can also be \nmodeled by using an activity diagram?\n\t\n4.\tExplain the difference between a use case and a \nscenario.

The clerk \nenters the contractor\u2019s name into the system. \nThe system displays the contractor\u2019s informa-\ntion, including current credit standing. The clerk \nthen opens up a new ticket (sale) for the contrac-\ntor. Next, the clerk scans in each item to be pur-\nchased. The system finds the price of the item \nand adds the item to the ticket. At the end of the \npurchase, the clerk indicates the end of the sale. \nThe system compares the total amount against \nthe contractor\u2019s current credit limit and, if it is \nacceptable, finalizes the sale. The system creates \nan electronic ticket for the items, and the con-\ntractor\u2019s credit limit is reduced by the amount of \nthe sale. Some contractors like to keep a record \nof their purchases, so they request that ticket \ndetails be printed. Others aren\u2019t interested in a \nprintout.\nA sale to the general public is simply entered \ninto the cash register, and a paper ticket is \nprinted as the items are identified. Payment can \nbe made by cash, check, or credit card. The clerk \nmust enter the type of payment to ensure that \nthe cash register balances at the end of the shift. \nFor credit card payments, the system prints a \ncredit card voucher that the customer must sign.\n\t\n2.\tBased on the following narrative, develop either \nan activity diagram or a fully developed descrip-\ntion for the use case of Add a new vehicle to an \nexisting policy in a car insurance system.\nA customer calls a clerk at the insurance \ncompany and gives his policy number.

The clerk then checks \nthe information to make sure the premiums are \ncurrent and the policy is in force.\nThe customer gives the make, model, year, \nand vehicle identification number (VIN) of the \ncar to be added. The clerk enters this informa-\ntion, and the system ensures that the given data \nare valid. Next, the customer selects the types \nof coverage desired and the amount of each. \nThe clerk enters the information, and the system \nrecords it and validates the requested amount \nagainst the policy limits. After all the cover-\nages have been entered, the system ensures the \ntotal coverage against all other ranges, including \nother cars on the policy. Finally, the customer \nmust identify all the drivers and the percent-\nage of time they drive the car. If a new driver is \nto be added, then another use case\u2014Add new \ndriver\u2014is invoked.\nAt the end of the process, the system up-\ndates the policy, calculates a new premium \namount, and prints the updated policy statement \nto be mailed to the policy owner.\n\t\n3.\tGiven the following list of classes and associa-\ntions for the previous car insurance system, list \nthe preconditions and postconditions for the use \ncase Add a new vehicle to an existing policy.\nClasses in the system include:\t \t\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPolicy\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nInsuredPerson\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nInsuredVehicle\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCoverage\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nStandardCoverage (lists standard insurance \ncoverages with prices by rating category)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nStandardVehicle (lists all types of vehicles \never made)\nRelationships in the system include:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPolicy has InsuredPersons (one-to-many)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPolicy has InsuredVehicles (one-to-many)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nVehicle has Coverages (one-to-many)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCoverage is a type of StandardCoverage\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nVehicle is a StandardVehicle\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The person must provide a current \nphysical address and telephone number as well as a cur-\nrent e-mail address. The system then maintains an open \naccount for this person. Access to the system as a seller is \nthrough a secure, authenticated portal.\nA seller can list books on the system through a special \nInternet form. The form asks for all the pertinent informa-\ntion about the book: its category, its general condition, and \nthe asking price. A seller may list as many books as de-\nsired. The system maintains an index of all books in the \nsystem so buyers can use the search engine to search for \nbooks. The search engine allows searches by title, author, \ncategory, and keyword.\nPeople who want to buy books come to the site and \nsearch for the books they want. When they decide to buy, \nthey must open an account with a credit card to pay for the \nbooks. The system maintains all this information on secure \nservers.\nWhen a purchase is made, TheEyesHaveIt.com sends \nan e-mail notice to the seller of the book that was chosen \nas well as payment information. It also marks the book as \nsold. The system maintains an open order until it receives \nnotice that the book has been shipped. After the seller re-\nceives notice that a listed book has been sold, the seller \nmust notify the buyer via e-mail within 48 hours that the \npurchase is noted. Shipment of the order must be made \nwithin 24 hours after the seller sends the notification e-\nmail. The seller sends a notification to the buyer and The-\nEyesHaveIt.com when the shipment is made.\nAfter receiving the notice of shipment, TheEyesHaveIt.\ncom maintains the order in a shipped status. At the end of \neach month, a check is mailed to each seller for the book \norders that have remained in a shipped status for 30 days. \nThe 30-day waiting period exists to allow the buyer to no-\ntify TheEyesHaveIt.com if the shipment doesn\u2019t arrive for \nsome reason or if the book isn\u2019t in the same condition as \nadvertised.\nIf they want, buyers can enter a service code for the \nseller. The service code is an indication of how well the \nseller is servicing book purchases. Some sellers are very \nactive and use TheEyesHaveIt.com as a major outlet for \nselling books.

For example, it will allow \nhim to maintain frequent communication with his \ndelivery trucks, which could save transportation and \nlabor costs by making the pickup and delivery opera-\ntions more efficient. This would allow him to serve his \ncustomers better. Of course, a more sophisticated sys-\ntem will be needed, but Bill\u2019s development consultant \nhas assured him that a straightforward and not-too-\ncomplex solution can be developed.\nHere is how Bill wants his business to operate. \nEach truck will have a morning and afternoon deliv-\nery and pickup run. Each driver will have a portable \ndigital device with a touch screen. The driver will be \nable to view his or her scheduled pickups and deliver-\nies for that run. (Note: This process will require a new \nuse case\u2014something the Agile development methodol-\nogy predicted would happen.) However, because the \ntrucks will maintain frequent contact with the home \noffice via telephony Internet access, the pickup/deliv-\nery schedule can be updated in real time\u2014even dur-\ning a run. Rather than maintain constant contact, Bill \ndecides that it will be sufficient if the digital device \nsynchronizes with the home office whenever a pickup \nor delivery is made. At those points in time, the route \nschedule can be updated with appropriate information.\nPreviously, customers were able to either call On \nthe Spot and request a package pickup or visit the com-\npany\u2019s Web site to schedule a pickup. Once customers \nlogged in, they could go to a Web page that allowed \nthem to enter information about each package, includ-\ning \u201cdeliver to\u201d addresses, size and weight category \ninformation, and type of service requested. On the \nSpot provided \u201cthree hour,\u201d \u201csame day,\u201d and \u201cover-\nnight\u201d services. To facilitate customer self-service, On \nthe Spot didn\u2019t require exact weights and sizes, but \nthere were predefined size and weight categories from \nwhich the customer could choose.\nOnce the customer entered the information for all \nthe packages, the system would calculate the cost and \nthen print mailing labels and receipts. Depending on \nthe type of service requested and the proximity of a \ndelivery truck, the system would schedule an immedi-\nate pickup or one for later that day. It would display \nthis information so the customer would immediately \nknow when to expect the pickup.\nPicking up packages was a fairly straightfor-\nward process. But there was some variation in what \nwould happen depending on what information was \nin the system and whether the packages were already \nlabeled. Upon arriving at the scheduled pickup loca-\ntion, the driver would have the system display any \npackage information available for this customer. If the \nsystem already had information on the packages, the \ndriver would simply verify that the correct informa-\ntion was already in the system for the packages. The \ndriver could also make such changes as correcting the \naddress, deleting packages, or adding new packages. If \nthis were a cash customer, the driver would collect any \nmoney and enter that into the system. Using a portable \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

If there were new pack-\nages that weren\u2019t in the system, the driver would enter \nthe required information and also print mailing labels \nwith his portable printer.\nOne other service that customers required was to \nbe able to track the delivery status of their packages. \nThe system needed to track the status of a package \nfrom the first time it \u201cknew\u201d about the package until \nit was delivered.

Though Jim lacked prior experi-\nence in health-care services, he\u2019d been hired due to \nexcellent performance in software development proj-\nects for a variety of firms in various industries. His skills \nin designing and deploying complex mobile applications \nwere especially valuable for several projects in progress \nat NMHS, including a reimplementation of the billing and \ninsurance reimbursement system and an upgrade to the \npatient portal that enables patients to view their medical \nrecords and to interact with their primary care providers \nvia a secure messaging system.\nFrom his first week on the job, Jim was concerned \nabout security and controls within NMHS\u2019s existing sys-\ntems and those under development. Jim gained little \ntraction with senior management when he raised those \nconcerns, but they did agree to let him hire an outside \nconsultant. Consequently, he\u2019d hired Alice Watts, a \nsecurity consultant with extensive health-care-related \nexperience, to complete a thorough analysis of existing \nsystems and to make recommendations for securing the \nsystems under development. Alice\u2019s analysis had taken \nalmost a month to complete. Jim had received some \ndisturbing preliminary findings as the work progressed, \nbut he hadn\u2019t yet seen the complete report.\nAt a meeting that included upper management, \nAlice presented her report. She began, \u201cThough I\u2019ll \ncover several security-related issues in my presenta-\ntion, I want to start by saying that there is far more good \nnews than bad about the security of your infrastructure \nand your existing systems. You have an excellent net-\nwork administrator. She\u2019s hardened your network and \nthe systems within it against malicious attacks. Bright \nspots include extensive encryption of data at rest and \nin transit, robust user authentication and authorization \nmethods, and a well-implemented system of access \ncontrols for your hardware, operating systems, data-\nbases, and applications.\u201d\nAlice continued, \u201cThough your infrastructure secu-\nrity methods do much to protect your systems from \noutside attack, I did find that internal controls within spe-\ncific systems are a hit-or-miss proposition. For example, \nyour system for transcribing recorded notes by physi-\ncians and other service providers doesn\u2019t incorporate \nthe latest dictionary-based technology to detect data-\nentry errors. Also, there\u2019s no requirement for review \nor approval by a supervisor or the health-care provider. \nBecause transcription is an error-prone process, you \nneed additional controls to ensure the integrity of patient \nmedical records\u2014especially for follow-up orders for lab \ntests, prescriptions, and downstream care coordination.\u201d\nRajesh Kumar (the chief financial officer) interrupted, \n\u201cWe\u2019re planning a pilot for an expensive text-to-speech \nsystem that will eliminate the need for transcription. \nWe were hoping to avoid spending any more time and \nresources on the current system.\u201d\nAlice replied, \u201cWhile I understand the sentiment, \nyou\u2019re opening yourself to medical errors and lawsuits \nin the interim. One transcription-related malpractice suit \ncould easily cost you far more than technology updates \nfor the current system.\u201d\nJim added, \u201cI\u2019ve investigated this issue further since \nAlice alerted me a couple of weeks ago. I think that we \ncan make the needed changes in a matter of weeks for \nabout $20,000.\u201d\nDiana Lourdes (the chief medical officer) replied while \nglancing at Rajesh, \u201cI think that\u2019s a prudent investment.\u201d\nAlice continued, \u201cThere are a few other easy-to-\nresolve issues with existing systems. But I\u2019d like to \nskip over them to what I think are much more impor-\ntant topics. My biggest security-related concerns are \nwith your two systems under development\u2014especially \nthe patient portal. Both systems open internal data to \noutside access. The billing application has some weak-\nnesses despite controls implemented within the Web \nservices interface. But the patient portal is your big-\ngest risk because it breaks new ground by enabling \nmobile browser-based access from ordinary users with \nuntrusted devices. Your current design, development, \nand deployment methods aren\u2019t up to the task of fully \nsecuring such a system. The risk of malicious attack and \naccidental data release through the patient portal is very \nhigh. You can\u2019t fully mitigate that risk with infrastructure-\nrelated security and controls bolted on to the system \nafter it\u2019s been developed. You have to design the secu-\nrity and controls into every part of the software and then \nlayer additional security on top.\u201d\nRajesh interrupted with considerable concern, \u201cIs \nthis project in danger? Do we need to start over?\u201d\nAlice replied, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far, but some \nimmediate changes are needed. I\u2019ll provide an executive \nsummary of my recommendations here. Then, I\u2019ll review \nmy detailed findings with Jim over lunch and with his \ndevelopment staff this afternoon. As part of that discus-\nsion, we\u2019ll revisit some of the design decisions made \nthus far, determine the impact on work already com-\npleted, and reassess the target deployment date.\u201d\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "159\nCHAPTER 6 \u25a0 Foundations for Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Overview\nPrevious chapters described the activities and decisions associated with dis-\ncovering and understanding the major elements of the user\u2019s requirements\u2014in \nother words, the analysis activities. This chapter focuses on the solution system. \n\u00ad\nDuring analysis, the focus is on understanding what the system should do (i.e., \nthe requirements), whereas during design, the focus is on the solution (i.e., speci-\nfying how the system will be built and what the structural components of the \nnew system will be).\nNew developers often ask, \u201cWhen are these tasks carried out in a real \nproject?\u201d Unfortunately, there is no single answer. Many projects begin \nwith some of the design decisions having already been made, particularly \nwith regard to the deployment environment, when companies already have a \nstrong technology infrastructure in place. For other projects, the new system \nmay be the result of a new thrust for the organization, and thus the decisions \nare wide open. However, it is normal for the project team to start thinking \nabout these issues very early in development and to begin making prelimi-\nnary decisions as requirements are being defined. The topics discussed in this \nand the following chapters are solution-oriented design topics; however, you \nshouldn\u2019t try to come up with a complete solution until you understand the \nproblem.\nThis is the first of several chapters that discuss design. This chapter briefly \ndescribes all the design activities and discusses the overarching issues of security \nand controls in more detail. Later chapters explore other design activities and \nexplain in detail the various models and techniques used for systems design.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0What Is Systems Design?\nThe term design has different meanings depending on the context in which it \nis used. For example, when designing a poster or banner, the designer is pri-\nmarily concerned with the message, text, and images, including their placement \nand stylistic elements, such as fonts and colors. The designer may also consider \nmaterials, such as paper for a small poster or tough and resilient plastics for a \nlarge banner stretched across a street. A good poster or banner design captures \nthe viewer\u2019s attention, clearly communicates the intended message in a way that \nleaves a lasting impression, and produces a final product durable enough to last \nas long as needed. The entire design can typically be completed by one person in \na matter of hours or days.\nIn contrast, design of a commercial aircraft is much more complex and \nconcerned with practical and functional aspects more than with stylistic ones. \nDesign typically starts with macro-level considerations, such as the aircraft\u2019s \nshape, size, and the number and placement of engines. From those decisions, \ndesigners move on to lower-level details and subsystems, such as internal engine \nmechanics, control surfaces, the fuel storage/delivery system, hydraulic flight \ncontrols, and myriad electrical subsystems. Designers also focus on minute \ndetails, such as the placement of rivets and welds, the size and shape of seats, \nand the placement of cockpit display and control devices. Because aircraft are \nso complex, multiple designers work over a period of months or years and coor-\ndinate their efforts with extensive drawings, mathematical models, and other \ndesign documents. The drawings and models also provide a way for designers \nto communicate with project managers, parts suppliers, designers of production \nmachinery, and the crews that will eventually build the planes.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "160\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Analysis, Design, and Implementation\nChapter 1 defined the term systems design as \u201cthose system development activi-\nties that enable a person to describe in detail how the resulting information sys-\ntem will actually be implemented.\u201d That definition was preceded by a definition \nof systems analysis: \u201cthose system development activities that enable a person to \nunderstand and specify what the new system should accomplish.\u201d The sequence of \nthe definitions implies that analysis precedes design. That is, to design anything, \nyou must first understand and specify what the final product will accomplish. \nIn the case of a banner or poster, analysis describes the message to be conveyed \nand physical aspects, such as physical size and where it will be displayed. In the \ncase of the commercial aircraft, analysis determines requirements, such as carry-\ning capacity, fuel consumption, range, maximum speed, reliability, maintenance \ncosts, longevity, and maximum construction cost. Those complex and interde-\npendent requirements drive a complex and interdependent set of design tasks.\nThe latter part of the systems design definition, \u201cdescribe\u2026how the result-\ning information system will actually be implemented,\u201d implies a direct and \nsequential link between design and implementation. That is, designers provide \nthe plans that others follow to build the final product or system. In the case of \na banner or poster, the designer provides a full-size or reduced-scale drawing \nand a set of construction specifications, such as size, material, thickness, and \nplacement of mounting grommets. The entire design is described in a few pages. \nIn contrast, the commercial aircraft design is described in thousands of docu-\nments and drawings that include detailed specifications for every part. In both \ncases, design results are recorded in documents and models that provide suffi-\ncient information to build the final product.\nFigure 6-1 summarizes aspects of design that you can glean from the poster/\nbanner and aircraft examples and apply to information systems design:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAnalysis provides the starting point for design.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDesign provides the starting point for implementation.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAnalysis and design document their results to coordinate the work of mul-\ntiple people and to communicate with downstream activities.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Design Models\nDuring the analysis activities described in previous chapters, we created docu-\nments and models. For object-oriented analysis, we create models such as class \ndiagrams, use case diagrams, use case descriptions, activity diagrams, sys-\ntem sequence diagrams, and state machine diagrams. The Online Chapter\u00a0B, \n\u201cThe\u00a0Traditional Approach to Requirements,\u201d presents the traditional analysis \nmodels, such as the event table, data flow diagrams, and entity-relationship dia-\ngrams. Regardless of the approach, design activities begin with documents and \nmodels created during earlier analysis activities. In other words, analysis out-\nputs are design inputs.\nIn iterative projects, analysis and design activities are often done concur-\nrently. However, the first focus of any iteration has to be identifying and specify-\ning the requirements for some part of the system (i.e., analysis); determining the \nsolutions (i.e., design) comes later.\nDuring analysis, analysts build models to represent the real world and to \nunderstand business processes and the information used in those processes. \nBasically, analysis involves decomposition\u2014breaking a complex problem with \ncomplicated information requirements into smaller, more understandable pieces. \nAnalysts then organize, structure, and document the problem domain knowl-\nedge by building requirements models. Analysis and modeling require substan-\ntial user involvement to explain the requirements and to verify that the models \nare accurate.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "161\nCHAPTER 6 \u25a0 Foundations for Systems Design\nDesign is also a model-building activity. Designers convert the information \ngathered during analysis\u2014the requirements models\u2014into models that represent \nthe solution system. Design is much more oriented toward technical issues, and \ntherefore requires less user involvement and more involvement by other systems \nprofessionals. The output of design activities is a set of diagrams and documents \nthat models various aspects of the solution system.\nThe formality of a project also affects design. Formal projects usually \nrequire well-developed design documents typically reviewed in formal meet-\nings. Developers on informal projects often create their designs with notepads \nand pencils and then throw away the design once the program is coded. This \nkind of informal design (used in many Agile projects) is merely a means to an \nend, which is the actual program code. However, even in Agile development, \nthe design activities described in this chapter are still completed. A developer \nwho jumps into writing software without carefully thinking it through\u2014often \nreferred to as cowboy coding\u2014ends up with errors, patches, and systems that \nare unreliable and difficult to update.\nFigure 6-2 identifies the major models used for analysis and design.

{"text": "163\nCHAPTER 6 \u25a0 Foundations for Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Design Activities\nFigure 6-3 identifies the activities of systems design. This section provides a \nshort introduction to each of these design activities. In-depth explanation and \ninstruction on the specific concepts and skills for each design activity are given \nlater in the text.\nSystems design involves specifying in detail how a system will work when \ndeployed within a specific technology environment. Some of the details may \nhave been defined during systems analysis, but much more detail is added dur-\ning design. In addition, each part of the final solution is heavily influenced by \nthe design of all the other parts. Thus, systems design activities are usually done \nin parallel. For example, the database design influences the design of application \ncomponents, software classes and methods, and the user interface. Likewise, the \ntechnology environment drives many of the decisions for how system functions \nare distributed across application components and how those components com-\nmunicate across a network. When an iterative approach to the SDLC is used, \nmajor design decisions are made in the first or second iteration; however, many \ndecisions are revisited and refined during later iterations.\nTo better understand these design activities, you can summarize each one \nwith a question. In fact, system developers often ask themselves these questions \nto help them stay focused on the objective of each design activity.

{"text": "164\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nThe following sections briefly discuss these design activities to better under-\nstand what is involved. In later chapters, you will develop the skills necessary for \neach of these activities.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Describe the Environment\nFor purposes of information systems design, the environment consists of two \nkey elements:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nExternal systems\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nTechnology architecture\nInteractions among external systems will usually have been identified and \ndescribed by analysis activities. During analysis, those descriptions show how \ninformation flows to and from external systems. To design application compo-\nnents and their embedded software classes and methods, additional information \nabout incoming and outgoing messages is needed, including:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPrecise message formats\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWeb or network addresses of sources and destinations\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCommunication protocols\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSecurity methods\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nError detection and recovery\nThe other key element, technology architecture, was defined in Chapter 2 as \nthe set of computing hardware, network hardware and topology, and system soft-\nware employed by an organization. For example, components of RMO\u2019s Consoli-\ndated Sales and Marketing System (CSMS) will be deployed on a set of computer \nservers, desktop computers, and mobile computing devices. Those devices will \ncommunicate across one or more networks employing multiple topologies and \nprotocols. Each computing device will have an operating system (OS), communi-\ncation capabilities, diverse input and output capabilities, and so forth. Additional \nsystem software, such as database management systems (DBMSs), Web server \nsoftware, and firewalls will operate on some of the computer systems. The entire \ncollection of hardware, system software, networks, and the yet-to-be-designed \napplication components will form an integrated and comprehensive solution. \nBecause the CSMS application software must interact with all of these elements \nonce deployed, defining this environment in detail precedes other design activities.\nTake a closer look at Figure 6-3, and note that all of the design activity \nnames except the first begin with the word design. In contrast, the environment \nis described rather than designed. Why is this first activity different? The answer \nlies in the relative amount of control a designer has over the environment ver-\nsus the other parts of the system. In general, the designer of a single system has \nlittle or no control over the environment. For example, with the RMO CSMS, \nthe DBMS, user identity management system, and external systems (e.g., a UPS \nshipping system) are beyond the control of the designer. System components \nmust be adapted to existing environmental elements, not the other way around.\nFurthermore, although an organization does have control over its technol-\nogy architecture, that control seldom extends to the designer of a single system. \nThe technology architecture supports all of an organization\u2019s systems, so each \nof their designs is adapted to that architecture. Thus, from the point of view of \na new system designer, the technology architecture is fixed, and the new system \nmust be designed to efficiently interact with it. In some cases, a new system will \nrequire changes to existing technology architecture. In those cases, any changes \nto the technology architecture are considered and decided upon by the orga-\nnization as a whole. Once those decisions are made, updating the architecture \nbecomes the first step in designing the new system. Chapter 7 covers details of \ntechnology architecture and description of the technology environment.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "165\nCHAPTER 6 \u25a0 Foundations for Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Design the Application Components\nAn application component is a well-defined unit of software that performs \none or more specific tasks. Though that definition sounds simple, it hides com-\nplex details, including the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSize/scope. A component could be small in size, like one method in a class \nor one script embedded within a Web page. Components can also be very \nlarge, like the order acceptance subsystem of an online store, a program \ncontaining thousands of lines of source code, or an entire Web site. Of \ncourse, application component size can also be between those extremes.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nProgramming languages. Programs, functions, subroutines, and procedures \nare application components defined by traditional programming languages, \nsuch as C or FORTRAN. Object-oriented programming languages, such \nas Java and C#, use classes and methods as application components. Com-\nponents written in scripting languages, such as JavaScript and PHP, are \nembedded within other application components such as Web pages. In \nshort, the names, sizes, and relationships among application components \nvary widely from one programming language and toolkit to another.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nBuild or buy? Some parts of an information system are written by an orga-\nnization\u2019s information technology (IT) development staff. Others can be \nreused from other information systems owned by the organization, pur-\nchased separately, or acquired as part of a developer\u2019s toolkit. Other com-\nponents might be deployed by an outside organization and made available \nvia a Web services interface (e.g., Google Maps or a Federal Express pack-\nage tracking service).\nKey decisions made when designing application components include how \nfunctions of the system will be grouped or packaged, and how they\u2019ll interact with \none another once built (or acquired) and assembled. One of the first steps in this \ndesign activity is separating the software into subsystems. Decisions are also made \nabout the database infrastructure and about the multilayer design in which the \nuser interface is separated from the business logic and database processing. The \ntechnology architecture will impact many of these design decisions. For example, \nan organization that employs Microsoft SQL Server and .NET will divide the \napplication into components that are easily developed and deployed within that \nenvironment. A different organization that employs ORACLE DBMSs and related \ntechnology architecture will define subsystems that match that environment, usu-\nally with significant differences from a .NET design and deployment.\nApplication component design precedes the later design of software classes. \nIn essence, application component design divides the functions of the system \ninto smaller packages, each of which must be further specified in terms of soft-\nware classes and methods. The result of application component design is a set of \nmodels (diagrams), often supplemented with other documents that provide addi-\ntional detail. Examples of models produced by this design activity are shown in \nFigure 6-5. Chapters 7 and 13 cover the concepts and techniques that underlie \nthese models.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Design the User Interface\nTo the user of a system, the user interface is the system. The quality of the user \ninterface can make or break a system after deployment. Poor-quality interfaces \ndeployed to customers and other external users often determine the failure of an \nentire business; high-quality user interfaces can be a competitive advantage. The \nreaction of employees to a new system interface can also determine system and \nbusiness success. High-quality interfaces improve employee productivity and \nmorale; poor-quality interfaces lead to errors and inefficiency.\napplication component\u2003 a well-defined \nunit of software that performs one or more \nspecific tasks\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "166\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nEver-improving technology expands and changes user-interface require-\nments. A decade ago, user-interface design was concerned primarily with sim-\nplifying the presentation of information on desktop computer monitors and \nminimizing task-related keystrokes and mouse clicks. In the modern world, \ndesigners must deal with multiple screens ranging from phones to large multi-\nmonitor displays. Multitouch screens, voice recognition, and built-in cameras \nthat follow a user\u2019s eye movements create new options and provide greater chal-\nlenges for user-interface designers. Users might interact with a system using one \ntechnology at their desk, another in a conference room, and yet another while \ntraveling. Designing a single user interface is now the exception, not the norm. \nThus, the term user interface should generally be considered plural rather than \nsingular.\nDesigning user interfaces can be thought of as both an analysis and design \nactivity. Analysis-related aspects include understanding the user\u2019s needs; how \nthe user carries out his or her job; and the locations, devices, and physical con-\ntexts of user-system interactions. Design-related aspects include the distribution \nand packaging of related software and determining which device capabilities \nand embedded software will be incorporated into an interface.\nMany types of models and tools are used to create a user-interface design, \nincluding mock-ups, storyboards, graphical layouts, and prototyping with \nscreen-modeling tools (see Figure 6-6).

The data model (the domain model class diagram) \nis created early during systems analysis and is then used to create the imple-\nmentation model of the database. Usually, the first decision is to determine the \ndatabase structure. Sometimes, the database is a collection of traditional com-\nputer files. More often, it is a relational database consisting of dozens or even \nhundreds of tables that interact with each other. Sometimes, files and relational \ndatabases are used in the same system.

Many of the technical (as opposed to functional) requirements defined \nduring systems analysis concern database performance needs (such as response \ntimes). Much of the design work might involve performance tuning to make sure \nthe system actually responds quickly enough. Security and encryption issues, \nwhich are important aspects of information integrity, must be addressed and \ndesigned into the solution. Given today\u2019s widespread connectivity, a database \nmay need to be replicated or partitioned at various locations around the world. \nIt is also not uncommon to have multiple databases with distinct DBMSs. These \ndatabases may be distributed across multiple database servers and may even be \nlocated at completely different sites. These highly technical issues often require \nspecialized skills from experts in database design, security, performance, and \nphysical configuration. A final key aspect of database design is making sure \nthe new databases are properly integrated with existing databases. Chapter 9 \ndescribes database design in detail.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Design the Software Classes and Methods\nDuring this design activity, analysis models, including class diagrams, system \nsequence diagrams, and state-machine diagrams, are extended to incorporate \nsoftware-specific elements. Designers also create additional models such as \nsequence diagrams. These models are blueprints for software methods that will \nbe programmed, tested, and eventually deployed. The purpose of this activity is \nto describe in enough detail how the software programs work, so that program-\nmers can write the code for the functions and methods. Figure 6-8 shows one of \nthe most important models generated during this activity: a sample design class \ndiagram for RMO\u2019s CSMS system. Chapters 12, 13, and 14 explain the details \nof designing software classes and methods, testing them, and packaging them \nfor deployment.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0System Controls and Security\nModern systems are subject to a variety of risks, ranging from malfunction due \nto incorrect data input, inadvertently revealing confidential information, and \nmalicious destruction by outside parties. The terms control and security are \nblanket terms for the wide variety of ways that system designers and operators \nmitigate such risks. Some controls and security methods are embedded within \nthe technology architecture. For example, most organizations have a unified \nmethod for identifying authorized users and providing them (and only them) \nwith access to the data and applications they need to do their jobs, using identity \nFigure 6-7 Sample database table definition in MYSQL\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

These controls are services shared across an \nentire organization\u2019s portfolio of applications.\nOther controls and security are system-specific, and must be specifically \ndesigned by that system\u2019s developers. For example, a payroll-processing sys-\ntem typically includes significant controls to ensure that only valid employees \nor supervisors submit payroll information, that correct computations are per-\nformed on valid data inputs, and to define which data and processing results can \nbe accessed by which users. Additional controls are part of the system\u2019s data-\nbase and are designed into its software methods. System-specific controls often \ninteract with organization-wide controls and security measures. For example, \nan application that enables employees to view and modify their own personal \npayroll information generally relies on organization-wide identity management \nmethods, such as usernames and passwords.\nThe importance of controls and security to modern systems might lead \nyou to believe that their design should be a security-specific design activity and \nshould be listed in Figure 6-3. Doing so would be consistent with security\u2019s \nimportance, but it would also obscure the fact that security and controls aren\u2019t \nseparate and distinct from other design activities. Rather, they are issues that \nneed to be embedded within all of the other design activities. That is, controls \nand security are important parts of other design activities, such as designing a \nuser interface, a database, or application components. Because they are embed-\nded in all other design activities, this chapter discusses key aspects so the con-\ncepts can be reused in the later design chapters.\n+processNewSale ( )\n+makePayment ( )\n<<controller>>\nSaleHandler\n-accountNo:string {key}\n-name:string\n-billingAddress:string\n-shippingAddress:string\n-dayPhone:string\n-nightPhone:string\n-emailAddress:string\n-status:string\nCustomer\n+updateName ( )\n+updateAddress ( )\n+requestHistory ( )\n-saleID:int {key}\n-saleDateTime:date\n-priorityCode:string\n-S&H:currency\n-tax:currency\n-totalAmt:currency\nSale\n+addItem ( )\n+updateInformation ( )\n+requestShipment ( )\n+updateStatus ( )\n+recievePayment ( )\n-saleItemId:int {key}\n-productItem:string\n-quantity:int\n-soldPrice:currency\n-shipStatus:string\n-backOrderStatus:string\nSaleItem\n+updateinformation ( )\n+cancelItem ( )\n+requestBackorder ( )\n-productItem:string\n-inventoryItem:int\n-size:string\n-color:string\n-options:string\n-quantityOnHand:int\n-averageCost:currency\n-reorderQuantity:int\n-dateLastOrder:date\n-dateLastShipment:date\nInventoryItem\n+updateQOH ( )\n+updateInformation ( )\nFigure 6-8 Partial design class \ndiagram for RMO\u2019s CSMS\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "171\nCHAPTER 6 \u25a0 Foundations for Systems Design\nthe two isn\u2019t precise because there is some overlap and because designers typi-\ncally use both types. This section explains integrity controls. Later sections dis-\ncuss security controls.\nThe primary objectives of integrity controls are as follows:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nTo ensure that only appropriate and correct business transactions occur\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nTo ensure that the transactions are recorded and processed correctly\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nTo protect and safeguard the assets of the organization (including hard-\nware, software, and information)\nAs described in the following subsections, organizations incorporate many \ntypes of controls into their systems and databases to achieve these objectives. \nEach control type addresses such specific issues as accuracy of inputs and limit-\ning access to authorized users. No control type is sufficient by itself to achieve \nall the objectives; thus, a layered and multifaceted system of controls is required.\n\u275a\n\u275aInput Controls\nInput controls prevent invalid or erroneous data from entering the system. \nInput controls can be applied to data entered by people or data transmitted from \ninternal or external systems. Input controls can be implemented within appli-\ncation programs, the database schema, or both. Commonly used input control \ntypes include:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nValue limit controls check numeric data inputs to ensure that the amount \nentered is reasonable. For example, the amount of a sale or the amount \nof a commission usually falls within a certain range of values. A control \nmight reject negative values or those that exceed a certain threshold, such \nas $10,000.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCompleteness controls ensure that all required data values describing an \nobject or transaction are present. For example, when a shipping address is \nentered, the system might check whether enough information has been pro-\nvided for successful delivery.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nData validation controls ensure that numeric fields containing codes or \nidentifiers are correct. For example, a program for entering letter grades \nfor a course might check that entered values match a set of predefined valid \ngrades (such as A, B, C, D, and F) and reject any other entries.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nField combination controls review various combinations of data inputs \nto ensure that the correct data are entered. For example, on an insurance \npolicy, the application date must be prior to or the same as the effective \ndate of policy coverage.\n\u275a\n\u275aOutput Controls\nSystems outputs come in various forms, including data output that is used by \nother systems, printed reports, and data displayed on traditional or mobile com-\nputer displays. Output controls ensure that output arrives at the proper des-\ntination and is accurate, current, and complete. It is especially important that \noutputs with sensitive information arrive at the proper destination and that they \ncannot be accessed by unauthorized persons. Common types of output controls \ninclude:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPhysical access controls to printers. Printers and printed outputs should be \nlocated in secure areas accessible only by authorized personnel.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDiscarded output control. Although often ignored during systems design, \nphysical control of discarded printed outputs containing sensitive data is \na must because dumpster diving is an effective way to access data without \nauthorization. Sensitive printed documents should be segregated from other \ntrash and shredded or burned.\ninput controls\u2003 controls that prevent invalid \nor erroneous data from entering the system\nvalue limit controls\u2003 controls that check \nnumeric data input to ensure that the value is \nreasonable\ncompleteness controls\u2003 controls that \nensure that all required data values describing \nan object or transaction are present\ndata validation controls\u2003 controls that \nensure that numeric fields that contain codes \nor identifiers are correct\nfield combination controls\u2003 controls that \nreview combinations of data inputs to ensure \nthat the correct data are entered\noutput controls\u2003 controls that ensure that \noutput arrives at the proper destination and is \naccurate, current, and complete\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "172\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAccess controls to programs that display or print. Program access con-\ntrols restrict which users can access specific programs and program func-\ntions, usually via such a mechanism as a username and password. In some \ninstances, a system designer might restrict program or function access by \naccess device. This extra safeguard is used primarily for military or other \nsystems that house workstations in secure areas and provide access to the \nsystem\u2019s information to anyone who has access to the area.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFormatting and labeling of printed outputs. System developers ensure com-\npleteness and accuracy by printing control data on the output report. For \nexample, every report should have a date and time stamp\u2014for the time the \nreport was printed and for the date(s) of the underlying data. To ensure that \na document is complete, designers typically incorporate such formatting \nfeatures as pagination in the \u201cpage \n of \n\u201d format, control totals, and \nan \u201cend of report\u201d trailer.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nLabeling of electronic outputs. Electronic outputs typically include internal \nlabels or tags that identify their source, content, and relevant dates. They \nmay also include control totals or checksums that enable the recipient to \ndetermine whether content has been lost or altered.\n\u275a\n\u275aRedundancy, Backup, and Recovery\nRedundancy, backup, and recovery procedures are designed to protect \n\u00ad\nsoftware and data from hardware failure and from such catastrophes as fire, \nflood, and malicious destruction. Most operating systems and DBMSs incor-\nporate support for all three. Many organizations that need continuous access \nto their data and systems employ redundant servers, databases, and sites. \nEach server or site hosts copies of application software, files, databases, and \nother important resources. Updates made to one server or site are immedi-\nately or frequently synchronized with the other copies to ensure consistency. \nIf one site or server fails, the others are still accessible, and the organization \ncontinues to function.\nBackup procedures make partial or full copies of a file system (data and \nsoftware) or a database to removable storage media, such as magnetic tape, or \nto data storage devices or servers at another site. Unlike redundant sites or serv-\ners, backup copies stored off-site can\u2019t be accessed directly by application soft-\nware or users. Instead, recovery procedures read the off-site copies and replicate \ntheir contents to a server that can then provide access to programs and users. \nBackup and recovery operations can take from minutes to hours. Backups are \ntypically scheduled during periods of low utilization. Recovery is performed \nwhen needed, and the database is unavailable until the recovery procedures are \ncompleted.\n\u275a\n\u275aFraud Prevention\nSystem designers and administrators are rightly concerned with security breaches \narising from outside the organization. But they often pay inadequate attention \nto an equally serious problem: the use of the system by authorized users to com-\nmit fraud. Obviously, integrity and security controls won\u2019t completely eliminate \nfraud; however, system developers should be aware of the fundamental elements \nthat make fraud possible and incorporate controls to combat it.\nIn the 1950s, fraud researchers developed a widely used model called the \nfraud triangle (see Figure 6-10). Much as a fire needs fuel, heat, and oxygen to \nburn, committing fraud requires three elements:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nOpportunity. The ability of a person to take actions that perpetrate a \nfraud. For example, unrestricted access to all functions of an accounts \npayable system enables an employee to generate false vendor payments.\nfraud triangle\u2003 a model of fraud that states \nthat opportunity, motivation, and rationaliza-\ntion must all exist for a fraud to occur\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Money is the usual \nmotivation, although a desire for status or power, or even the need to be a \n\u201cteam player\u201d may be contributing factors.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nRationalization. An excuse for committing the fraud or an intention to \n\u201cundo\u201d the fraud in the future. For example, an employee might falsify \nfinancial reports to stave off bankruptcy, thus enabling fellow workers to \nkeep their jobs. Or an employee might steal money to pay a gambling debt \nor medical bills, with the intention of repaying the money later.\nSystem designers have little or no control over motive and rationalization, \nbut they can minimize or eliminate opportunity by designing and implementing \neffective controls.

{"text": "174\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nto the objectives enumerated earlier for integrity controls, security controls have \ntwo further objectives:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMaintain a stable, functioning operating environment for users and appli-\ncation systems (usually 24 hours a day, 7 days a week).\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nProtect information and transactions during transmission across insecure \nenvironments such as public wireless networks and the Internet.\nThe first objective\u2014to maintain a stable operating environment\u2014focuses \non security measures to protect the organization\u2019s systems from external attacks \nfrom hackers, viruses, and worms, as well as denial-of-service attacks. The most \ncommon security control against such risks is a firewall installed between inter-\nnal systems and the Internet (see Figure 6-9).\nThe second objective\u2014to protect transactions during transmission\u2014focuses \non the information that is sent or received via the Internet. Once a transaction \nis sent outside the organization, it could be intercepted, destroyed, or modified. \nThus, designers define security controls that protect data in transit from the \nsource to the destination.\nThe most common security control points are network and computer operat-\ning systems because they exercise direct control over such assets as files, applica-\ntion programs, and disk drives. All modern operating systems contain extensive \nsecurity features that can identify users, restrict access to files and programs, \nand secure data transmission among distributed software components. Because \noperating system security is the foundation of security for most information sys-\ntems, a key task in defining security controls is determining which operating \nsystem security features will be enabled and how they will be configured.\n\u275a\n\u275aAccess Controls\nAn access control limits a user\u2019s ability to access resources, such as servers, \nfiles, Web pages, application programs, and database tables. Operating systems, \nnetworking software, and DBMSs all provide access control systems, and all of \nthese can be configured to share a common access control system. Access con-\ntrol systems rely on these common elements:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAuthentication is the process of identifying users who request access to \nsensitive resources. Users can be authenticated through methods (or factors) \nsuch as usernames and passwords, smart cards, challenge questions and \nresponses, or biometric methods, including fingerprint and retinal scans, or \nvoice recognition. Multifactor authentication uses multiple methods for \nincreased reliability.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAn access control list is a list attached or linked to a specific resource \nthat describes users or user groups and the nature of permitted access (e.g., \nread data, update data, or execute program). Users who don\u2019t appear in the \naccess control list can\u2019t use the associated resource.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAuthorization is the process of allowing or restricting a specific authenti-\ncated user\u2019s access to a specific resource based on an access control list.\nTo build an effective access control system, a designer must categorize system \nusers and determine what type(s) of access each resource requires. \u00ad\nFigure\u00a06-12 \nillustrates three user categories or types and the role of the access control system \nin allowing or restricting their access:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUnauthorized users are people who aren\u2019t allowed access to any part or \nfunction of the system. Such users include employees who are prohibited \nfrom accessing all of the system, former employees who are no longer per-\nmitted to access the system, and outsiders, such as hackers and intruders.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nRegistered users are those who are authorized to access the system. \nNormally, types of registered users are defined depending on what they are \nauthorized to view and update. For example, some users may be allowed \naccess control\u2003 a control that limits a \nuser\u2019s ability to access resources, such as \nservers, files, Web pages, application pro-\ngrams, and database tables \nauthentication\u2003 the process of identify-\ning users who request access to sensitive \nresources\nmultifactor authentication\u2003 the process \nof using multiple authentication methods for \nincreased reliability\naccess control list\u2003 a list attached or \nlinked to a specific resource that describes \nusers or user groups and the nature of permit-\nted access\nunauthorized users\u2003 people who aren\u2019t \nallowed access to any part or function of the \nsystem\nauthorization\u2003 the process of allowing or \nrestricting a specific authenticated user\u2019s \naccess to a specific resource based on an \naccess control list\nregistered users\u2003 people who are autho-\nrized to access the system\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Encryption is the process of altering data so \nunauthorized users can\u2019t view them. Decryption is the process of converting \nencrypted data back to their original state. Data stored in files, or databases on \nhard drives or other storage devices, can be encrypted to protect against theft. \nData sent across a network can be encrypted to prevent eavesdropping or theft \nduring transmission: A thief or eavesdropper who steals or intercepts encrypted \ndata receives a meaningless group of bits that are difficult or impossible to con-\nvert back into the original data.\nAn encryption algorithm is a complex mathematical transformation that \nencrypts or decrypts binary data. An encryption key is a binary input to the \nencryption algorithm\u2014typically a long string of bits. The encryption algorithm \nvaries the data transformation based on the encryption key, so data can be \ndecrypted only with the same key or a compatible decryption key. Many encryp-\ntion algorithms are available, and a few\u2014including Data Encryption Standard \n(DES) and several algorithms developed by RSA Security\u2014are widely deployed \ngovernmental or Internet standards. An encryption algorithm must generate \nencrypted data that are difficult or impossible to decrypt without the encryp-\ntion key. Decryption without the key becomes more difficult as key length is \nincreased, and sender and receiver must use the same or compatible algorithms.\nFigure 6-13 shows an example of symmetric key encryption, in which \nthe same key encrypts and decrypts the data. A significant problem with sym-\nmetric key encryption is that sender and receiver use the same key, which must \nbe created and shared securely. Security is compromised if the key is transmit-\nted over the same channel as messages encrypted with the key. Further, sharing \na key among many users increases the possibility of key theft. Because of these \nrisks, symmetric key encryption is frequently used with data stored in files and \ndatabases, but is used only in conjunction with asymmetric encryption to trans-\nmit data over a network.\nData stored by file and database servers can be encrypted with symmetric \nkey encryption to protect against unauthorized access that bypasses the OS or \nDBMS to directly access the physical data store. Typically, the encryption key is \nstored on a different server that is queried via secure login when the server first \nboots up. Data stored on laptops and other portable devices are often encrypted \nto protect against unauthorized access due to loss, theft, or disposal.\nencryption\u2003 the process of altering data so \nunauthorized users can\u2019t view them\ndecryption\u2003 the process of converting \nencrypted data back to their original state\nencryption algorithm\u2003 a complex math-\nematical transformation that encrypts or \ndecrypts binary data\nencryption key\u2003 a binary input to the \nencryption algorithm\u2014typically a long string \nof bits\nsymmetric key encryption\u2003 an encryption \nmethod that uses the same key to encrypt and \ndecrypt the data\nFigure 6-13 Symmetric key encryption\nSecret key\nSecret key\nPerson 1\nPerson 2\nSame key\nInternet\nMessage:\nHow are you?\nMessage:\nHow are you?\nMessage:\nwp93nznieh?\nMessage:\nwp93nznieh?\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "177\nCHAPTER 6 \u25a0 Foundations for Systems Design\nAn additional security measure for portable devices is a technique com-\nmonly called remote wipe, which automatically deletes sensitive data from \nportable devices under certain conditions, such as repeated failure to enter a \nvalid username and password, or an attempt to access a database or file from an \nunauthorized application. Remote wipe is commonly used with apps on porta-\nble devices that sync sensitive data from a server. An unauthorized synchroniza-\ntion attempt triggers the remote wipe via a command from the app or the server.\nAsymmetric key encryption uses different, but compatible keys to encrypt \nand decrypt data. Public key encryption is a form of asymmetric key encryp-\ntion that uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The \ntwo keys are like a matched pair. Once information is encrypted with the public \nkey, it can be decrypted only with the private key. It can\u2019t be decrypted with the \nsame public key that encrypted it. Organizations that use this technique broad-\ncast their public key so it is freely available to anybody who wants it. For exam-\nple, a company transmitting shipment data to a shipper can access the public key \nfrom the shipper\u2019s Web site and encrypt the shipment information before trans-\nmission. The shipper then decrypts the message with the private key. Because no \none else has the private key, no one else can decrypt the message.\nSome asymmetric encryption methods can encrypt and decrypt messages in \nboth directions. That is, in addition to using the public key to encrypt a message \nthat can be decrypted with the private key, an organization can also encrypt \na message with the private key and decrypt it with the public key. Notice that \nboth keys must still work as a pair, but the message can go forward or back-\nward through the encryption/decryption pair. This second technique is the basis \nfor digital signatures and certificates, which are explained in the next section. \n\u00ad\nFigure 6-14 illustrates an asymmetric key encryption transmittal.\n\u275a\n\u275aDigital Signatures and Certificates\nEncryption is an effective technique for a secure exchange of information between \ntwo entities who have appropriate keys.

A \ndigital signature is a technique in which a message or document is encrypted \nwith a private key and decrypted with the public key. For example, your bank \nmight encrypt a message sent to you with its private key. If you decrypt the mes-\nsage with your bank\u2019s public key and the message is readable, then you know \nthe message was sent by your bank. If you decrypt the message with the public \nkey and the result is gibberish, then you know the message was not sent by your \nbank. Encoding a message with a private key is called digital signing.\nTaking the example one step further, you can ask the question, \u201cHow do I \nknow that the public key I have is the correct public key and not some counter-\nfeit key?\u201d In other words, maybe someone is impersonating another entity and \npassing out false public keys to intercept encoded messages (such as financial \ntransactions) and steal information. In essence, the problem is ensuring that the \nkey purported to be the public key of some institution is, in fact, that institu-\ntion\u2019s public key. The solution to that problem is a certificate.\nA certificate\u2014or digital certificate\u2014is an institution\u2019s name and public key \n(plus other information, such as address, Web site URL, and validity date of the cer-\ntificate), encrypted and certified by a third party. Many third parties, such as Veri-\nSign and Equifax, are very well known and widely accepted \u00ad\ncertifying authorities. \nIn fact, they are so well known that their public keys are built right into the current \nbrowsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer. As shown in Figure \n6-15, you can know that the entities with whom you are communicating are, in fact, \nwho they say they are, and that you do have their correct public key.\nAn organization or individual who wants a certificate with his or her name \nand public key buys a certificate from a well-known certifying authority such \nas VeriSign. The certifying authority encrypts the data with its own private key \n(signs the data) and gives the data back to the original entity. When someone, \nsuch as a customer, asks you for your public key, you send the certificate. The \ncustomer receives the certificate and opens it with the certifying authority\u2019s pub-\nlic key. Because the certifying authority is so well known, its public key is built \nin to everyone\u2019s browser and is essentially impossible to counterfeit. The cus-\ntomer can now be sure that he or she is communicating with you and can do so \nwith encrypted messages by using your public key.\nA variation of this scenario occurs when a buyer and seller transmit their cer-\ntificates to one another. Each participant can decrypt the certificate by using the \ndigital signature\u2003 a technique in which a \ndocument is encrypted by using a private key \nto verify who wrote the document\ndigital certificate\u2003 an institution\u2019s name \nand public key (plus other information, such \nas address, Web site URL, and validity date \nof the certificate) encrypted and certified by \na third party\ncertifying authorities\u2003 widely accepted \nissuers of digital certificates\nFigure 6-15 Using a digital certificate\n1.

The \nauthority stores certificate data, including public keys, within its database and \nverifies transmitted certificates by matching their content against the database.\n\u275a\n\u275aSecure Transactions\nSecure electronic transactions require a standard set of methods and protocols \nthat address authentication, authorization, privacy, and integrity. Netscape orig-\ninally developed the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to support secure transac-\ntions. SSL was later adopted as an Internet standard and renamed Transport \nLayer Security (TLS), although the original name is still widely used.\nTLS is a method for secure message transmission over the Internet. Sender \nand receiver first establish a connection by using ordinary Internet protocols and \nask each other to create a TLS connection. Sender and receiver then verify each \nother\u2019s identity by exchanging and verifying identity certificates as explained \npreviously. At this point, either or both have exchanged public keys, so they \ncan send secure messages. Because asymmetric encryption is quite slow and dif-\nficult, the two entities agree on a protocol and encryption method\u2014usually a \nsingle-key encryption method. Of course, all the messages to establish a secure \nconnection are sent by using the public key/private key combination. Once the \nencryption technique has been determined and the secret, single key has been \ntransmitted, all subsequent transmission is done by using the secret, single key.\nIP Security (IPSec) is a newer Internet standard for secure message trans-\nmission. IPSec is usually implemented by operating systems or within network \nhardware devices, which enables it to operate with greater speed. IPSec can \nreplace or complement SSL. The two protocols can be used at the same time \nto provide an extra measure of security. IPSec supports more secure encryption \nmethods than SSL.\nHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an Internet standard \nfor securely transmitting Web pages. HTTPS supports several types of encryp-\ntion, digital signing, and certificate exchange and verification. All modern Web \nbrowsers and servers support HTTPS. It is a complete approach to Web-based \nsecurity, although security is enhanced when HTTPS documents are sent over \nsecure TLS or IPSec channels.\nSecure Sockets Layer (SSL)\u2003 a standard \nset of methods and protocols that address \nauthentication, authorization, privacy, and \nintegrity\nTransport Layer Security (TLS)\u2003 an Inter-\nnet standard equivalent to SSL\nIP Security (IPSec)\u2003 an Internet standard \nfor secure transmission of low-level network \npackets\nHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure \n(HTTPS)\u2003 an Internet standard for \nsecurely transmitting Web pages\nCHAPTER Summary\nSystems design is the process of organizing and struc-\nturing the components of a system to enable the con-\nstruction of the new system. The design encompasses \nkey parts of the system, including its environment, ap-\nplication components, user interfaces, database, and \nsoftware classes and methods. A description or design \nactivity is associated with each design element. Design \nactivity inputs consist of the models that were built \nduring analysis. The outputs of the design consist of \na set of diagrams, or models, that describe the archi-\ntecture of the new system and the detailed logic within \nvarious programming components.\nKey design elements include application com-\nponents, the user interface, the database, and soft-\nware classes and methods. Each element is the focus \nof a separate design activity, though the timing and \nordering of activities varies from project to project. \nA\u00a0separate activity also defines the environment within \nwhich the system will be built and operated. Environ-\nmental characteristics tend to limit design choices and \nflexibility.\nIntegrity controls operate within a specific sys-\ntem to reject invalid data inputs, prevent unauthorized \ndata outputs, and protect data and programs against \naccidental or malicious tampering. Security controls \ncross multiple systems to protect assets of an organiza-\ntion from all threats, with a primary focus on external \nthreats. Although integrity and security controls are \nimportant design elements, there is no separate activ-\nity to create them; control development is included in \neach of the other design activities to ensure a robust \nand reliable system.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "186\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nOpening case\u2002 Technology Decisions at Wysotronics Inc.\nAs James Schultz walked down the hall toward a meeting \nwith his staff, he thought about his current job. For a year \nnow, Schultz had been the vice president and chief infor-\nmation officer for a medium-sized supplier of electronic \ncomponents to several large electronics firms, including \nSamsung and Acer. James\u2019s company, \u00ad\nWysotronics Inc., \nhad been in business for many years, but had recently \nbeen having some problems with its internal computer \nsystems. James was hired to fix the problems.\nSoon after starting this job, James discovered that \nmost systems were functioning properly, but that the \ninfrastructure was a hodgepodge of disjointed comput-\ners and networks. On the corporate side, there were \naccounting systems and human resource systems, both \nof which were desktop client/server systems hosted on \na local network computer that resided in the Accounting \nDepartment.\nEngineering had its own database and network com-\nputers, which hosted several sophisticated engineering \nsystems with intensive computing requirements. The \nengineers\u2019 local desktop systems were the most recent, \nup-to-date equipment and software. The server was \nalso high capacity, with a large data repository to house \nall the engineering documents and images.\nMarketing and Sales also had their own systems \nhosted on their own network server, which was con-\nnected to the Internet. The sales staff worked closely \nwith the manufacturing and assembly plants to ensure \nthat deliveries were on time, and they were frequently \non the road, visiting Wysotronics\u2019s clients. It was their \njob to ensure that clients were satisfied with schedules, \ndeliveries, and product quality, and they wanted to be \nable to access the sales and production databases while \nthey were on the road. Unfortunately, the servers they \nused weren\u2019t very stable and continually had problems.\nPerhaps the biggest problem was the supply chain \nmanagement system. Wysotronics had a large manu-\nfacturing plant, an assembly plant, and several suppliers \nthat needed access to the inventory and supply chain \nsystem. The current infrastructure didn\u2019t have enough \ncapabilities to provide timely information to these facili-\nties and suppliers.\nToday\u2019s meeting objective was to plan and config-\nure the total infrastructure of corporate systems. As he \nwalked into the room, James was greeted by William \nHendricks, who would be making a presentation sum-\nmarizing past decisions and future directions.\n\u201cHi, Bill,\u201d James said. \u201cWill you have some new \nrecommendations for us today? Are there any surprises \nfrom your research?\u201d\n\u201cNo surprises,\u201d Bill said. \u201cBut you will be pleased to \nknow that our research has validated the decisions you \nhave made recently. We are providing better service to \nthe company than ever before, and we are doing it at \nless cost than we ever have before. I do have a few rec-\nommendations about how to fine-tune our infrastructure \nto provide even better service, though.\u201d\nIt was obvious that Bill was pretty enthused about \nthe results of his research.\n\u201cBefore we start, can you give me a brief idea about \nwhere the cost savings are coming from?\u201d James asked.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Bill said. \u201cAs you know, we decided to cre-\nate a virtual private network using the Internet for all \nour supply chain and production needs. We moved all \nthe computers to support this system into a colocation \nfacility. We still own the servers, but we have signed a \nservice agreement with the hosting company to main-\ntain the operating system and network. This has allowed \nus to focus our efforts on the software itself and not \ndistract valuable personnel with environment or con-\nnectivity issues. We also have not had to invest in addi-\ntional buildings for a larger data center. Plus, the level of \nservice is incredible. We have had almost 100 percent \nuptime since the switchover. The people in our plants \nreally are pleased that they can check inventory levels \nand shipment dates from all their suppliers at any time.\u201d\n\u201cWow. That is great news,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd what \nare you going to recommend for our marketing and sales \nsystem?\u201d\n\u201cWell, as you know, that is a Web-based system,\u201d \nBill replied. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the security requirements \nthat our production systems do, but it needs to be \nwidely available. Our research has shown that we can \ndeploy that system through a hosting company that \nprovides cloud computing. We have the option of going \nwith our colocation provider or using another company \nwe have used in the past. I think this other company is \ngoing to give us some good price concessions and will \nstill be able to provide excellent service.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds great!\u201d James said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in \nhearing about the details. I assume you have also laid out \na migration plan to move the systems over?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I have done my homework on this one,\u201d Bill \nsaid. \u201cI think you will be pleased with the results.\u201d\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Overview\nRequirements defined during analysis activities are usually stated in a techno-\nlogically and architecturally neutral way. That is, they\u2019re stated in a way that \nenables designers to choose from a variety of technologies and architectures \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "190\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Networks, the Internet, and the World Wide Web\nThe true power of modern computing lies not just in the ubiquity and power \nof individual computers, but in the ability to interconnect them. Social net-\nworking services such as Facebook, information resources such as Wikipedia \nand Google Search, and shopping applications like Amazon.com all rely on the \ninterconnection of millions of computers, their users, and the resources that \nthey manage.\nA computer network is a collection of hardware, software, and transmission \nmedia that enables computing devices to communicate with one another and to \nshare resources. Networks come in many sizes\u2014ranging from small networks \nthat span a single home or office to international networks that connect coun-\ntries and continents.\nNetworks of all sizes interconnect with one another to form the Internet. The \nInternet is sometimes called the network of networks because it interconnects mil-\nlions of private, public, business, academic, and government networks. The Inter-\nnet acts a global highway for information exchange among computing devices and \ntheir users. The largest networks within the Internet are called Internet backbone \n\u00ad\nnetworks. They provide the high-capacity, high transmission speeds, and reli-\nability needed to carry billions of messages across regions, countries, and conti-\nnents. Most are owned and operated by governments or large telecommunications \ncompanies.\nAt the other end of the network size scale are local area networks (LANs), \nwhich typically span a single home, small office, or one floor of a building. \n\u00ad\nServers and personal computing devices connect wirelessly or via cables to \nLANs. LANs, in turn, connect to the Internet via larger networks spanning \ngroups of buildings, cities, or regions.\nThe World Wide Web, sometimes called the WWW or simply the Web, is \nan interconnected set of resources accessed via the Internet. Though the terms \nInternet and Web are used interchangeably in everyday language, the distinction \nbetween them is important for information system designers. The Internet is the \n\u201chighway\u201d over which messages and information travel from network to net-\nwork, server to personal computing device, and service provider to end user. The \nWeb is the set of resources and services that can be accessed via that highway.\nWeb resources vary widely and include static documents (i.e., Web pages), \nimages, videos, e-mail and other messages, and software-based services such as \nshopping sites and online games. Web resources are identified by a Uniform \nResource Locator (URL) composed of three parts, as shown in Figure 7-6. \nInternet backbone network\u2003 a high-\ncapacity and high-speed computer network \nthat carries large amounts of Internet traffic \nacross regions, countries, and continents\nlocal area network (LAN)\u2003 a small \n\u00ad\ncomputer network typically spanning a single \nhome, small office, or one floor of a building\nWorld Wide Web (WWW)\u2003 an intercon-\nnected set of resources accessed via the \nInternet\nUniform Resource Locator (URL)\u2003  \nidentifier of a Web resource containing a \nprotocol header, server name or address,  \nand resource name\nFIGURE 7-6 Parts of a Uniform Resource Locator\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Figure 7-7 shows the software components within blue \n \ncallout boxes.\nSoftware components can be loosely grouped into two types. Application \nsoftware includes software that performs user- or business-specific tasks, such \nas shopping, preparing customer purchase invoices, generating monthly finan-\ncial statements, or enabling a user to play games against the computer or other \nusers. Some application software is distributed as an app, which is installed \nonce on a computer or cell phone\u2019s storage device. Other applications are con-\nstructed as Web-based applications that run within a Web browser and install \nlittle or no software on the user\u2019s device.\nSystem software is software that works behind the scenes to support \napplication software and to control or interact with hardware or software \nresources. Examples include operating systems (OSs), database management sys-\ntems, Web browsers, and Web server software. OSs are an especially important \nclass of business software because they\u2019re installed on every computing device \nand because they provide so many support functions used by application soft-\nware. To a significant extent, the OS controls what a device can and can\u2019t do, \nthus enabling or limiting the application software that can be used on the device.\n\u275a\n\u275aWeb-Based Applications\nApplications such as the Amazon shopping application are constructed as \n\u00ad\nWeb-based applications.

{"text": "192\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nServer-side software components that execute on or are called from a  \nWeb server\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUse of Web standards for communication between Web browser and server\nThe reasons that Web applications are so common include ease of access \nand use of widely adopted Web standards. However, those benefits come at a \ncost. Web applications are a well-defined target for security breaches because \nURLs and Web standards are open and widely known. Also, application perfor-\nmance can suffer when networks are congested.\nThe impact of these challenges on the Amazon shopping application is \nsignificant. Amazon servers employ elaborate mechanisms to protect against \nthreats such as denial-of-service attacks, bogus transactions, and interception \nof customer credit card and other sensitive information in transit. To ensure \nadequate performance for a global customer base, Amazon uses redundant and \nglobally distributed servers connected to Internet backbone networks.\n\u275a\n\u275aEmbedded Software\nA modern laptop computer, tablet computer, or cell phone comes preinstalled \nwith a very complex OS, a Web browser, and a rich set of preinstalled apps. The \nOS has embedded software that provides functions for graphical display, touch \nscreen and gesture-based input, voice recognition, speech generation, music \nand video playback, and access to the Internet and Web resources. Embedding \nthese capabilities within the OS enables preinstalled or purchased apps and \nWeb-based applications to reuse the software that implements these functions. \nThat reuse provides important benefits, including a similar look and feel across \napplications and application development toolkits for software developers that \nautomate many programming tasks and provide a direct interface to software \nalready embedded in the device.\nEmbedded software components extend the functions of Web browsers and \nWeb servers in ways that enhance Web-based applications and the user experi-\nence. Examples include the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nToolbars. A set of links to Web resources or installed apps that extend the \ncapabilities of a Web browser. For example, an Acrobat PDF toolbar pro-\nvides Acrobat help links and one-click access to PDF document creation \nand management software.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPlug-ins. Web browser plug-ins are often used to correctly display certain \ntypes of Web content. For example, Amazon provides plug-ins to enable \nusers to preview 30-second music clips before purchasing and downloading \ndigital music files.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWidgets. An example of a Web browser widget is a time-and-temperature \nor stock market widget that is always displayed in one corner of the \nbrowser no matter what Web page is being viewed. An example of a widget \ninstalled within a Web page is a program that display statistics, such as \nuser comments or visits to the page.\nThe combination of a computing device\u2019s OS, apps, Web browser, and \nembedded components creates a software environment within which an app or \nWeb-based application operates. That environment provides a set of supporting \nfunctions for application software, but it also creates significant development, \ndeployment, and support issues. One such issue is whether software developers \ndeliver application software as an app or Web-based application. If they develop \nan app, they gain some advantages like improved performance, higher-quality \nuser-interface features, and the ability to perform some functions while not con-\nnected to the Internet. But they also incur the costs of supporting multiple OSs. \nFor example, if developers want their apps to be installable on most cell phones, \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "193\nCHAPTER 7 \u25a0 Defining the System Architecture\nthen they\u2019ll need to develop and support three different apps\u2014one for iOS, one \nfor Android, and another for Windows.\nDeveloping application software that works on many device types\u2014for \nexample, desktops, laptops, and tablets (in addition to cell phones)\u2014adds even \nmore complexity. Fundamental differences in hardware and screen size forces \ndevelopers to adapt application software in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. For \ninstance, the keyboard and mouse/touch pad of a desktop or laptop computer \nmay dictate one style of data input, while the small virtual keyboard and touch \nscreen of a tablet or cell phone will dictate another approach. Screen size dictates \nsignificant differences between application software designed for a cell phone \ncompared with software designed for a desktop computer and its large\u00a0display.\nThe Amazon shopping application has an interesting approach to dealing \nwith this complexity. Amazon doesn\u2019t provide installable apps for iOS, Android, \nand Google devices. Users with devices running those operating systems use \na Web application, and Amazon invests considerable resources in developing \nserver-side application software that adapts its user experience to the software \nenvironment of the user\u2019s device. However, Amazon has also released its own \ncell phone and a version of the Kindle e-reader tablet under the name Amazon \nFire with a customized version of the Android OS. That OS includes embed-\nded software and preinstalled apps that provide direct access to various Ama-\nzon services, including shopping. In essence, Amazon has developed a complete \nhardware and software environment that is fine-tuned for access to Amazon \nservices. UPS and FedEx follow a similar strategy with the devices carried by \ndelivery personnel to record, track, and process shipments.\nIn sum, the benefits of the rich embedded software architecture of most \nend-user computing devices are real\u2014reuse of already-installed software, simi-\nlar look and feel across multiple apps, and faster app development. But those \nbenefits are coupled with significant problems of incompatibility and complex-\nity for system designers and developers. Designers must decide which embedded \nsoftware components will be included in their systems, and they must design \ntheir application software for that embedded software. Those choices determine \nthe range of devices that can execute the application software and the costs of \nmaintaining and upgrading it for years to come.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Protocols\nA protocol is a set of languages, rules, and procedures that ensure accurate and \nefficient data exchange and coordination among hardware and software compo-\nnents. Modern information systems rely on hundreds or thousands of protocols. \nHardware, software, and network components abide by protocols because their \nowners and users value the results of accurate and efficient data exchange and \ncoordination. Given the complex interconnected world of modern information \nsystems, not abiding by protocols is unthinkable because no system could func-\ntion without them. Figure 7-8 shows types of protocols and their use within the \nAmazon.com shopping application.\n\u275a\n\u275aNetwork Protocols\nNetwork protocols enable accurate message transmission among the various \ncomputers and software components. They function as the \u201cplumbing\u201d that \nenables messages to find their way from sender to recipient, enable multiple \ndevices to efficiently share wireless and wired connections, and handle tasks \nsuch as identifying and retransmitting lost messages. Network protocols are \nimplemented within all computers and network hardware devices.\nIt is rare that an information system designer needs to be concerned with \nnetworking protocols other than their security implications.

This is an important issue because \nmany computers and networks employ software programs or hardware devices \ncalled firewalls. Firewalls examine incoming and outgoing packets and block \nthose arriving from or sent to \u201cdangerous\u201d URLs or network address. Thus, an \ninformation system designer must ensure that network messages among soft-\nware components won\u2019t be blocked by a firewall at either end.\nFor increased security, the system designer may want to work with security \nand network specialists to develop a virtual private network (VPN) to isolate \nsensitive communications between servers or between an organization\u2019s own \nemployees and servers. A VPN incorporates technologies covered in \u00ad\nChapter\u00a06, \nincluding Secure Sockets Layers, Transport Layer Security, and secure IP, to \nreliably identify senders and recipients, and encrypt network messages sent \namong them.\nThe Amazon.com shopping application doesn\u2019t use secure network proto-\ncols for server-to-customer communication until the user needs to transmit sen-\nsitive data, such as when providing credit card information. All traffic among \nAmazon servers and those of its key partners, such as payment processors and \nshippers, is secured using virtual private networks.\n\u275a\n\u275aWeb Protocols\nThe World Wide Web is built on a small family of protocols for encoding \nWeb documents and hyperlinks, requesting documents from Web servers, \nand responding to those requests. The most important protocols include the \nfollowing:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nURL. As defined earlier, a URL defines a document or resource name, \nlocation, and encoding protocol.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTML defines the structure and \ncontent of a Web page, including encoding methods for text, images, tables, \nand forms with the ability to control such aspects as text font and size, and \nthe location of text and images on a displayed or printed page.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nExtensible Markup Language (XML). XML is an extension to HTML \nthat enables groups of users to define additional encoding within Web \ndocuments.

For example, in Figure 7-3 the text $13.22 might \ninclude additional encoding information that identifies it as a product \nprice stated in U.S. dollars. A price comparison service could use such \ninformation to compare prices for the same product across multiple \n\u00ad\nshopping sites.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP defines the format and \n\u00ad\ncontent of requests for Web documents and resources, and includes some \nsimple commands for other types of requests, such as uploading a file or \npage. For example, Web browsers normally request that a Web page be \ntransmitted for display via the HTTP GET command. Data entered by a \nuser in an HTML form is normally transmitted back to a Web server using \nthe HTTP POST command.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). HTTPS is an extension of \nHTTP that employs secure network protocols to reliably identify senders \nand recipients and encrypt network messages sent among them.\nAs with network protocols, Web protocols are nearly universal and thus of \nlittle direct concern to information system designers. The primary issue is which \nversions of Web protocols are supported by software on servers and end-user \ncomputing devices. For example, HTML5 is a recent update to earlier HTML \nprotocol versions. It provides some new capabilities that Web application and \nWeb service developers may want to incorporate into their systems. However, \nmany users have older computing devices and software that don\u2019t support \nHTML5. Thus, a system developer must decide whether to\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nRely exclusively on an older HTML protocol version, sacrificing some \nfunctionality\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nRely only on HTML5 and thus not serve users with older or outdated \ndevices\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWrite multiple versions of software, one for each supported protocol  \nversion\nNote that this sort of decision isn\u2019t unique to Web protocols. It occurs with \nother types of protocols and with support for specific operating systems.\nA user\u2019s initial connection to the Amazon.com shopping application uses \na URL that initiates the transfer of a Web page from an Amazon server to the \nuser\u2019s Web browser. At that time, the Amazon Web server queries the user\u2019s \nWeb browser to determine its type, what protocols it supports, and the underly-\ning OS. That information is stored for the duration of the user\u2019s connection and \nused to adapt HTML documents to the specific characteristics and capabilities \nof the user\u2019s device. When sensitive data needs to be transmitted, the server ini-\ntiates an HTTPS connection with the browser to verify its identity and encrypt/\ndecrypt transmitted data. Data sharing among Amazon.com servers, includ-\ning its key partners, uses XML encoding and employs secure network and \n \nWeb protocols.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Architectural Concepts\nIn Chapter 2, we defined two key terms that we\u2019ll spend most of this chapter \nexploring:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nTechnology architecture.

{"text": "196\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nThe technology architecture defines the infrastructure that supports appli-\ncation software and the services it provides. Application software is deployed \non a technology architecture by distributing application components to specific \nhardware devices and connecting them via networks and protocols.\nTechnology and application architecture are interdependent. Poor technology \narchitecture provides a weak foundation for application software and can com-\nprise its performance, reliability, and other characteristics. Good technology archi-\ntecture enhances those characteristics and provides other benefits, such as minimal \noperating cost and flexible updating. But high-quality technology architecture can\u2019t \nmake up for poor application architecture. Application software must be designed \nto ensure ease of construction, deployment, operation, and future updates.\nPopular literature and culture usually refer to technology in abstract terms, \nand there is an underlying assumption that any useful technology will be \nadopted and exploited. But an organization must trade off the potential benefits \nof adopting and deploying useful technologies with the cost of supporting those \ntechnologies and the possibility of overextending its ability to manage and suc-\ncessfully exploit them. For example, should an organization immediately move \nits applications to \u201clatest and greatest\u201d technologies, or should it wait until it \nbecomes clearer which of those technologies are useful and widely adopted? \nOnce it decides to adopt a technology, which \u201cflavor(s)\u201d should it choose? What \nspecific hardware, software, and protocols should it deploy and support?\nThese are important questions because no organization has sufficient \nresources to constantly reimplement existing information systems using all pos-\nsible new and updated technologies. An organization must choose technologies \nthat match its application needs and support those technologies over a period of \nyears or decades. The technology architecture must evolve slowly over time to \nenable new functions, new ways of working, and new ways of interacting with \ncustomers and strategic partners.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Software as a Service\nA service is something that we purchase rather than making or doing it our-\nselves. For example, we consider our household utilities such as water, electricity, \nand trash pickup to be services. We don\u2019t have to have our own power generator \nto get electricity. We just buy power as we use it. Another example is service on \nour vehicles. When something breaks on our cars, we pay an auto mechanic to \nfix it. We don\u2019t usually operate our own repair shop. We purchase repair services \nfrom someone who does.\nSoftware as a service (SaaS) follows that same basic idea. If an orga-\nnization requires some services\u2014for example, bookkeeping and accounting \nfunctions\u2014it could build or buy an accounting software system. Alternatively, \nit could find a firm that provides accounting services and buy only the account-\ning services it needs. As with any other utility service, it would purchase and \npay only for those services it requires. It doesn\u2019t have to purchase\u2014or install or \nmaintain\u2014the software system.\nMany applications employ the SaaS model. Examples include the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSocial networking services such as Facebook, Tumblr, and Pinterest\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nApplication software suites such as Google Apps and Adobe Creative Suite\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSpecialized applications such as the Amazon.com shopping application and \nthe UPS.com shipping application\nTwo common features shared by most applications that employ the SaaS \nmodel include the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nLittle or no application software is installed on the user\u2019s device.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUser data is stored on servers, though copies may be stored on the user\u2019s \ndevice for improved performance.\nsoftware as a service (SaaS)\u2003 a software \ndelivery model similar to a utility, in which \napplication software is accessed via the \nInternet without locally installed programs\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Although the term can be used to refer to applications such as those listed \nabove, it more commonly refers to smaller and more focused applications, such \nas transmitting shipping information from seller to shipper, or single functions, \nsuch as looking up the zip code that matches a shipping address. In those con-\ntexts, a Web service is a software function or related set of functions that can \nbe executed via Web standards. In essence, a Web service is a software function, \nsubroutine, method, or program that meets the following criteria:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIs \u201ccalled\u201d from one application via a URL or other Web protocol\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAccepts input data embedded within the URL or via another protocol\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nExecutes on the Web service owner\u2019s servers\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReturns processing results encoded within a Web page or document\nWeb services enable software functions developed by organizations to be \nembedded within the information system of another organization. For exam-\nple, consider the shipping options for an Amazon.com purchase, as shown \nin \u00ad\nFigure\u00a07-9. If the user selects the one-day shipping option, how will the \n\u00ad\nAmazon Web application determine what shipping charge to apply to the order? \nThe\u00a0Amazon Web application knows the address of the warehouse that holds \nthe items to be shipped and the customer\u2019s address. It also knows the approxi-\nmate dimensions of a box that will hold the purchased item, and it can calculate \nthe weight based on the weight of the enclosed items, box, and packing materi-\nals. What the Amazon.com Web application doesn\u2019t know and can\u2019t calculate \nitself is how much a shipper such as FedEx or UPS will charge to deliver the box.\nShipping companies provide Web services that enable companies like \n\u00ad\nAmazon.com to compute shipping charges. Amazon\u2019s Web application passes \nshipment data to the Web service, and the shipper\u2019s software computes the \ncharge and then passes it back to the Amazon.com Web application.

For items that are out of stock, the Web application can \ninteract with publisher Web services to locate available sale items and estimate \nthe time to ship them to an Amazon warehouse or direct ship then from the \n\u00ad\npublisher warehouse to a customer.\nThe implications of Web services for system design are significant. Summa-\nrized at the strategic level, information system developers must do the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nScan the range of available Web services and decide which to incorporate \ninto their software. To the extent they include other Web services, they \nexpand the functions of their own software with minimal related develop-\nment cost.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDecide which (if any) functions of their own software should be implemented \nas Web services and made available to other systems. To the extent they do \nso, they increase the potential base of software users, but also commit to \nmaking those services available in a reliable and secure fashion over a long \ntime period.\nAt a more detailed level, the decision to use or provide Web services leads \nto many other questions about system design, development, and deployment, \nincluding the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWhat protocols will be used to accept Web service calls and to pass data in \nboth directions?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHow will data passed to/from Web services be secured?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEven if no Web services are made available to external users, should some \nportions of the system be structured as Web services to facilitate access and \nuse by other internal systems?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWhat performance and availability guarantees will be provided to Web \n\u00ad\nservice users?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWhat server, network, and other resources are needed to satisfy those \nguarantees?\nWe\u2019ll revisit some of these questions in the examples later in this chapter.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Distributed Architectures\nDistribution of system components across machines, server farms, and oceans is \nan inescapable facet of modern system architecture. Consider again the \u00ad\nAmazon \nshopping application shown in Figure 7-8. Participating organizations (e.g., \nAmazon, Visa, MasterCard, UPS, and FedEx) each operate their own server \nfarms in the locations of their choice. Further, to serve a global market and to \nprovide higher performance and fault tolerance, each organization distributes its \nservers and software across dozens of locations throughout the world. Thus, a \nshopping session for a customer in California might be processed in an Amazon \nserver farm in Canada. The Canadian servers might interact with UPS servers in \nJapan and Visa servers in Germany.\n\u275a\n\u275aClient/Server Architecture\nClient/server architecture is a method of organizing software to provide and \naccess distributed information and computing resources. It divides software \ninto two classes: client and server. A server manages system resources and pro-\nvides access to these resources through a well-defined communication interface. \nA client uses the communication interface to request resources, and the server \nresponds to these requests.\nThe client/server architectural model can be applied in many ways. A sim-\nple example is how desktop computers access a shared printer on a LAN, as \nshown in Figure 7-10. An application program on a desktop computer sends a \nclient/server architecture\u2003 a software \ndesign and deployment method that divides \nsoftware into components that manage \nresources and components that use those \nresources\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The server acknowledges the client request and notifies the client \nwhen the document is sent to the printer.\nNote that in the context of client/server architecture, the term server doesn\u2019t \nrefer to computer hardware. Rather it refers to software that might be embedded \nwithin an operating system, be implemented as a separate system software com-\nponent such as a database management system, or provided as a service acces-\nsible via Web protocols. A server within client/server architecture can be hosted \nwithin a hardware device, such as a smart printer, or one or more computer \nsystems called servers. Server computer systems might host a single service or \nmany different services. Also, a single service might be replicated across many \ndifferent computing systems or server farms to make its services available to \nmany geographically dispersed clients.\nIn Figure 7-8, the customer\u2019s laptop computer acts as a client while talk-\ning to the server components of the Amazon.com shopping application. In turn, \nthe Amazon.com shopping application acts as a client to shipper and payment-\nprocessing Web services. Thus, it is possible (and common) for a single software \ncomponent or system to be both client and server.\n\u275a\n\u275aThree-Layer Architecture\nThree-layer architecture is a variant of client/server architecture that is used \nfor all types of systems, from internally deployed desktop applications to glob-\nally distributed Web-based applications. Three-layer architecture divides the \napplication software into three layers that interact, as shown in Figure 7-11:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nThe user interface or view layer, which accepts user input and formats and \ndisplays processing results\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nThe business logic layer or domain layer, which implements the rules \nand procedures of business processing\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nThe data layer, which manages stored data, usually in one or more \ndatabases\nthree-layer architecture\u2003 a client/server \narchitecture that divides an application into \nview layer, business logic layer, and data layer\nview layer\u2003 the part of a three-layer  \narchitecture that contains the user interface\nbusiness logic layer\u2003 also known as the \ndomain layer, the part of a three-layer architec-\nture that contains the programs that implement \nthe business rules and processes\ndata layer\u2003 the part of a three-layer \n\u00ad\narchitecture that interacts with the data\nFigure 7-10 Network printing \nservices implemented with client/\nserver architecture\nView layer\nDomain layer\nData layer\nUser request\nUser request\nData access\n response\nData access\n response\nData access\n request\nData access\n request\nUnformatted\n response\nUnformatted\n response\nInformation\n request\nInformation\n request\nFormatted\nresponse\nFormatted\nresponse\nFigure 7-11 Three-layer architecture\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Figure 7-12 illustrates an internally deployed system with a three-\nlayer architecture, and it shows how the three layers might be configured across \nthree separate computing platforms: desktop and laptop clients, a Web/applica-\ntion server, and a database server.\nThe view layer resides on all the client computers. The HTML is interpreted \nand displayed by the Web browser on the client computers. The view layer soft-\nware components that format the HTML are on the application server. The \ndata layer consists of the database server and any application programs on the \napplication server that are necessary to access the data. The business logic layer \nresides on the application server computer and includes all the logic to process \nthe business rules.\nA major benefit of three-layer architecture is its inherent flexibility. Interac-\ntions among the layers are always requests or responses that follow a Web or \nother protocol, which make the layers relatively independent of one another. \nIt\u00a0doesn\u2019t matter where other layers are implemented or on what type of com-\nputer or operating system they execute. The only interlayer dependencies are a \ncommon protocol for requests and responses and a reliable network with suf-\nficient communication capacity.\nMultiple layers can execute on the same computer, or each layer can \noperate on a separate computer. Complex layers can be split across two or \nmore computers. System capacity can be increased by splitting layer functions \nacross computers or by load sharing across redundant computers. In the event \nof a malfunction, redundancy improves system reliability because the server \nload can be shifted from one computer to another. In sum, three-layer archi-\ntecture provides the flexibility needed by modern organizations to deploy and \nredeploy information-processing resources in response to rapidly changing \nconditions.\nFigure 7-12 Internal deployment with three-layer architecture\nDatabase server\nView layer\nWeb/application server\nDomain layer\nData layer\nSoftware layers\nDomain layer logic\u2014implement business rules\nData layer logic\u2014formulate queries\nView layer logic\u2014format screens/reports\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "201\nCHAPTER 7 \u25a0 Defining the System Architecture\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Interoperability\nIt\u2019s natural to feel a bit overwhelmed at this point in the chapter. We\u2019ve described \nhardware, software, protocols, and multiple architectural concepts. You\u2019ve \nencountered many new terms and acronyms and have developed some new per-\nspectives on things that you thought you already understood. You\u2019re probably \nsearching for a framework into which you place all of the new and updated infor-\nmation. You\u2019re also wondering: What does it all have to do with systems design?\nInteroperability is a perspective through which you can examine all of the \ndetails covered thus far. Interoperability is the ability (or lack thereof) of a \ncomponent or system to interact with other components or systems. The myriad \nhardware and software components that make up a modern information system \nmust work together. To ensure interoperability, system designers must do several \nthings, including the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUnderstand and describe the current environment in which the system will \noperate. That environment includes existing hardware and software com-\nponents, networks, and the protocols and APIs already in use.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nLook for existing software components and services that can provide \nneeded functions for the new system. Those functions must be interoper-\nable with the existing environment and with components that will be built.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nBuild components that can\u2019t be purchased as software modules or used as a \nservice. As with acquired components, these must be interoperable with all \nother system components and with existing environments.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nStructure and assemble the components in a way that is feasible to build, \ntest, deploy, and operate over the long term.\nThat sounds like a tough and complex job because it is. Successful system \ndesigners are knowledgeable and experienced. They acquire a broad and deep \nknowledge of all of the topics discussed thus far in this chapter. They learn to \napply that knowledge by working as developers and by gradually completing \ndesign tasks for larger and more complex subsystems and systems. They constantly \nupdate their knowledge to keep up with rapidly changing technology. And they \nwork in teams because no one person can hold and successfully apply all of the \nknowledge needed to design and deploy a large-scale modern information system.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Architectural Diagrams\nArchitectural diagrams are commonly used to visually describe an information \nsystem\u2019s environment, components, and deployment. As with other diagrams used \nin systems design, architectural diagrams summarize complex details in a way \nthat\u2019s easy for people to understand. The following sections briefly look at three \nwidely used architectural diagrams: location, network, and deployment diagrams.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Location Diagrams\nLocation diagrams are commonly used to show the geographic placement of \nvarious system components, including hardware, buildings, and users. Location \ndiagrams are developed early in the design process to describe a system\u2019s envi-\nronment. A simple example from the RMO case will suffice to show how loca-\ntion diagrams are constructed.\nRMO\u2019s main offices consist of the corporate headquarters as well as a large \nretail store, a manufacturing plant, and a large distribution warehouse in Park \nCity, Utah. Park City is where the company got its start and where it opened \nits first retail store.

Furthermore, a new system isn\u2019t developed in a technology \u00ad\nvacuum. \nRather, the owning organization has many existing systems and a \u00ad\ntechnology \narchitecture that supports them. Thus, any new system must \u00ad\nintegrate with that \ntechnology architecture. If the new system requires \u00ad\ntechnology \u00ad\narchitecture \nchanges, they must be carefully considered and coordinated with the existing \narchitecture and systems.\nYou\u2019ve already reviewed many key aspects of external systems and technol-\nogy architecture. You\u2019ve also learned about three different types of diagrams \nthat can be used to summarize environment information. The rest of this section \nfirst explores some of the key questions that must be answered when describing \nthe environment. It then looks at a specific RMO example to show you how \nthose questions are applied in practice. Finally, it discusses some specific issues \nof data integration that must be addressed when interconnecting multiple appli-\ncation components and systems.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Key Questions\nA useful way of starting to describe the environment is to pose a series of ques-\ntions. The answers to those questions provide a pool of information to be sum-\nmarized in diagrams and supporting text. The following questions are a typical \nstarting point:\n1.\t What are the key features of the existing or proposed technology environ-\nment that will support or constrain the system?\na.\t What operating systems will be used?\nb.\tWhat other system software (e.g., Web server, database \u00ad\nmanagement, and \nintrusion detection software) will be used?\nc.\t In what ways are network messages filtered or otherwise secured? Are \nany changes required to support interactions with external systems or \nuser-interface devices?\nd.\tWhat APIs and development tools are compatible with the existing \n\u00ad\ntechnology environment?\n2.\t With what external systems and databases will the system under devel-\nopment interact? For each system or database, answer the following \nquestions:\na.\t What is the timing and frequency of each interaction?\nb.\tWhat is the data content of inputs to and outputs from the system?\nc.\t What protocols will format and encode data flowing to or from the  \nexternal system?\nd.\tWhat are the security requirements of each inflow and outflow?\ne.\t What security methods and protocols will be used to satisfy the security \nrequirements?\n3.\t What devices will be used for automated inputs and outputs?\na.\t What protocols will format and encode data flowing to or from the \n\u00ad\ndevices?\nb.\tWhat are the security requirements of each inflow and outflow?\nc.\t What security methods and protocols will be used to satisfy the security \nrequirements?\nd.\tWhat APIs and development tools are compatible with the existing \n\u00ad\ntechnology environment and required automated inputs and outputs?\n4.\t What user-interface technology will be used?\na.\t Where will users be located?\nb.\tWhat hardware device(s) will users use?\nc.\t What operating systems will run on \u201csmart\u201d user-interface devices?\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "206\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nThe following subsections briefly address the impact of these updates as \nanswers to the key questions posed above.\n\u275a\n\u275aMobile Devices and Apps\nThe current technology architecture connects users to the system using desktop \nor laptop computers. Expanding the range of user devices to include tablets and \nsmartphones will require updates to the supporting system software, APIs, and \ndevelopment tools. The current system relies on servers running the \u00ad\nWindows \noperating system with Internet Information Server as the Web server. That \ninfrastructure is sufficient to support apps in all of the current flavors (iOS, \nAndroid, and Windows) though additional plug-ins will have to be installed and \nconfigured in each device to support each app type.\n\u275a\n\u275aWeb Technologies and Adapted Content\nBecause some users won\u2019t install an app, the CSMS must also support a browser-\nbased user interface with support for multiple screen sizes, Web browsers, and \nplug-ins. That will require more complex user-interface coding than exists in the \ncurrent system, which simply serves static Web pages and forms. The updated \nuser-interface coding will need to query the user\u2019s device and browser and adjust \nthe content of the Web pages transmitted to match the device characteristics. As \nwith the apps, this may require supporting more modern Web protocols such as \nHTML5 and updated APIs and development tools.\nStructuring newly deployed applications as Web services will require \u00ad\nchanging \nthe way that RMO configures and manages servers. Note that each server in \nFigure 7-16 is dedicated to a specific system. Modern technology \u00ad\narchitecture \nthat supports Web services generally organizes servers by type of service \n \n(e.g., Web, application, database, or video content) with each server \u00ad\nhosting \n\u00ad\nservices or components from multiple information systems. In addition, groups \nof servers are generally deployed for each service type to provide service \n\u00ad\ncontinuity in case one machine fails.\n\u275a\n\u275aSocial Networking\nSome of the impacts of incorporating social networking into the system mirror \nthose described earlier for apps and Web pages that adapt to the user\u2019s device. \nSocial networking services provide the ability to interface with external systems \nin two ways:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nA Web services interface\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAn API and toolkit that enable developers to create customized functions \nand embed them within the social networking site and interface\nAdditional research is required to determine whether one or both of these \nmethods are needed to implement the social networking capabilities of the \nnew CSMS. That research must be repeated for each social networking ser-\nvice (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Google+) with which the CSMS \nwill interact. Of course, the choice of interaction method, the Web services \nprotocols, and the API and development toolkit will vary among the social \nnetworking services.\n\u275a\n\u275aSecurity Implications\nSupporting apps, multiple browsers with plug-ins, and interfaces to social \nnetworking sites will probably require security updates to the current tech-\nnology architecture. Apps will need to be digitally signed prior to distribu-\ntion via the app stores for each device\u2019s operating system. In addition, some \nbrowsers and plug-ins require transmission of digitally signed code frag-\nments that are encrypted with the organization\u2019s public key. Similarly, social \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

{"text": "207\nCHAPTER 7 \u25a0 Defining the System Architecture\nnetworking services implement stringent security protocols to protect them-\nselves against malicious plug-ins and intrusions via Web services. Designers \nof the updated CSMS will have to work closely with system and network \nadministrators to determine what updates to security configuration will be \nrequired.\n\u275a\n\u275aUpdated RMO Technology Architecture\nFigure 7-17 updates Figure 7-16 to explicitly incorporate support for mobile \ndevices, apps, and social networking. Note the increased complexity of the dia-\ngram, including additional user-interface devices, upgraded network speeds, \nan increase in the number of servers, grouping servers by service type, the \naddition of content management servers for images and videos, and additional \nexternal service providers. The diagram doesn\u2019t capture additional complexity \nassociated with updated security configuration and more complex software \nhosted within RMO\u2019s application servers. Increased network bandwidth is \nneeded throughout the architecture due to use of Web services, the increased \ncomplexity of user interfaces, and increased use of graphics and video. Note \nthat transition from the old technology architecture to the new may take \nmonths or years due to the need to redeploy and update legacy systems not \nreplaced by the CSMS.\n\u275a\n\u275aExternal Hosting\nThe right side of Figure 7-17 summarizes a lot of complexity and cost. Updates \nto the data center will be expensive, as will operating, managing, and maintain-\ning it over time. Further, locating all key software and hardware assets in a \nsingle data center is risky. RMO risks customer dissatisfaction and loss of sales \nrevenue if the data center were to be offline for any reason.\nExternal hosting of all or part of the CSMS is an option that can reduce risk, \nimprove performance, and possibly reduce cost. Hosting the application with a \nnational or global company, such as Google or Amazon, would enable RMO \nto take advantage of an existing and highly distributed computing infrastruc-\nture. Key components could be replicated at multiple locations to improve per-\nformance and to provide fault tolerance. Costs might be lower due to improved \neconomies of scale. Even if costs were the same or slightly higher, they might be \njustified by improved performance and fault tolerance.\nFigure 7-17 RMO\u2019s updated \ntechnology architecture for the CSMS\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "208\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Designing Application Components\nChapter 6 defined an application component as a well-defined unit of soft-\nware that performs one or more specific tasks. That definition masked some \nimportant details, including variations in component size ranging from single \nsubroutines or methods to entire subsystems; variations in programming lan-\nguage, protocols, and supporting system software; and the ability to build, buy, \nor freely access components as Web services of entire SaaS systems. This sec-\ntion concentrates on defining the functions and boundaries of larger application \ncomponents, including Web services and subsystems. Design of smaller applica-\ntion components, such as classes and packages, is covered in later chapters.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Application Component Boundaries\nSystems analysis activities collect and document various aspects of systems \nrequirements that are needed to design application components. A key question \nto be answered when designing application components is which components \nwill perform which functions? Answering this question can be approached from \na top-down or bottom-up perspective. With a top-down approach, the designer \nthinks of the entire system as a single component performing all of the functions \ndescribed during analysis activities. The designer then breaks this large com-\nponent into smaller components in a generic process called factoring. With the \nbottom-up approach, the designer considers each function separately and looks \nfor similarities as a basis for grouping software that implements the functions \ninto larger application components.\nWith either approach, the designer looks for similarities among system \nfunctions to guide factoring or grouping. But how does a designer determine or \nmeasure similarity among system functions? When answering that question, it \nhelps to focus on specific analysis activity descriptions like events and use cases. \nEvents and use cases incorporate attributes that can be used to measure similar-\nity, including the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nActors. Each use case identifies one or more specific actors. Software for \nuse cases that interact with the same actors is a candidate for grouping into \na single application component.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nShared data. Use cases that interact with the same domain class(es) are \ncandidates for grouping into a single application component.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEvents. Use cases that are triggered by the same external, temporal, or state \nevent are candidates for grouping into a single application component.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0RMO CSMS Application Architecture\nLet\u2019s illustrate how use case similarities can be used to define the boundaries of \napplication components for a portion of RMO\u2019s CSMS. Figure 7-18 combines \ninformation about use cases, domain classes, and events as defined in earlier \nchapters and shows all use cases in which Customer is an actor or user. The \nfar-right column shows prospective groupings of those use cases, which are dis-\ncussed further below.\nGroups A\u2013D include all use cases related to sale or return activities that can \nbe performed online by the customer (Groups C and D) or with the assistance of \na phone (Groups A and C) or store sales representative (Groups B and C). Group \nD includes use cases that are unique to the customer\u2019s online experience, includ-\ning the online shopping cart. Group E cases cover various nonshopping aspects \nof the customer experience, such as product ratings and friend links. In essence, \nGroups C\u2013E describe the customer\u2019s entire online experience while interacting \nwith the CSMS.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Interacts with the customer by phone while \nusing a desktop computer to perform sale and return functions\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nStore sales representative. Interacts with the customer in person while using \na point-of-sale terminal or tablet computer\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCustomer.

Performs return functions using a tablet or desktop computer\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nManagement. Performs order and shipment functions using a tablet, \n\u00ad\nlaptop, or desktop computer\nIf the domain model is implemented within a single database, the underlying set \nof use cases can be organized as one data layer interacting with one or more busi-\nness layers. Use cases could be grouped into business layers in multiple ways. For \nexample, each use case group could be a separate business layer. However, because \nall of the use cases (Groups A\u2013D) have significant overlaps in users, domain classes, \nand events, it makes sense to combine them into a single business layer.\nThe single business layer interacts with multiple view layers, each optimized \nfor a different combination of user and device. View layers are customized for \neach user type by omitting connections to irrelevant use cases and by optimizing \nthe user-interface design to workflow and context. For example, the user inter-\nface for a phone sales representative would omit Groups B, D, and E use cases \nand be optimized for rapid data entry using a desktop computer with multiple \nlarge displays. In some cases, such as a shipping representative using a tablet or \ndesktop computer, a single view layer can support multiple device types. In other \ncases, such as customers shopping online, different view layers are required for \nsome devices due to significant differences in device capability or screen size.\nFigure 7-19 shows a deployment diagram describing the three-layer archi-\ntecture for the CSMS use cases in Figure 7-18. Note that the diagram distributes \nthe three layers across two servers\u2014one hosting the data layer and the other \ncombining the business and view layers. Of course, the two servers could be \nclustered or replicated across multiple locations. The diagram represents one \ndistinct CSMS subsystem in enough detail to enable user-interface, database, \nand lower-level software design activities to proceed.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Application Component Integration\nModern application developers are often faced with the task of integrating leg-\nacy systems, purchased application components, third-party SaaS applications, \nand custom-developed components.

{"text": "211\nCHAPTER 7 \u25a0 Defining the System Architecture\nwill replace the legacy phone and retail store sales systems, but not the Supply \nChain Management (SCM) system. Recall from Chapter 1 that a Tradeshow \nSystem is also under development. Also, like any large company, RMO has other \nsystems, including a SaaS Financial planning & peporting (FPR) system and a \npurchased Human resource management (HRM) system. Figure 7-20 summa-\nrizes the RMO systems and their interactions.\nTransaction information that affects accounting records and financial \nreports flows into the FPR system from three other systems. If the systems were \nall internally developed and implemented, the FPR system could directly access \nthe databases of the other systems. But because the FPR is a SaaS application, \ndevelopers at RMO have no control over its internal implementation. Because \nit\u2019s impractical for a SaaS provider to rewrite their application to access the \nunique internal systems of every client, most SaaS developers take one or more \nof three approaches to data inflow from other systems:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nBatch data export and import. Data from the source system is extracted \nand stored in a \u201cneutral\u201d format such as a comma-delimited, Excel, or \nXML file. The files are stored in an accessible location such as an FTP \nserver and the SaaS system periodically executes a script that copies the \nfile(s) and imports their contents.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nData import via Web services. The SaaS system provides general-purpose \nWeb services for data import. User organizations develop customized data \nexport software to extract data from their systems or databases and pass \nit to the SaaS system via Web service calls. Data export/import can occur \nperiodically in batches or per update in real time.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDirect access to commonly used third-party applications. When a sufficient \nnumber of clients use the same purchased or SaaS software for other pur-\nposes, a SaaS provider might develop a specific data export/import utility \nfor that system. For example, many colleges use BlackBoard Learn as a \nlearning management system and Elucian Banner as their student informa-\ntion system. Because each system needs access to the other\u2019s data, both ven-\ndors have an incentive to develop data export/import software that directly \naccesses the database of the other system.\nRMO currently uses batch data export and import to move financial data \nfrom the SCM and HRM systems to the FPR system. RMO-developed scripts \nexport purchase and return transactions from the previous day and store them \nin an Excel file at midnight. The FPR system is configured to access that file at \nFigure 7-20 RMO subsystems \nand data flows\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The drawback is that financial records \ndon\u2019t reflect purchasing transactions as they occur. A manager viewing purchas-\ning-related accounts through the FPR system is looking at yesterday\u2019s data.\nHRM data export to the FPR system is handled similarly, though the export \noccurs every two weeks to coincide with payroll generation and the file format \nis XML. The drawbacks and benefits are similar, though the issue of managers \naccessing \u201cold\u201d data through the FPR system is more significant. Employee time \nand attendance data is captured daily through the HRM system, but that data \nisn\u2019t shown on RMO financial reports until payroll is generated. Extra accounting \nsteps are thus required at the end of each month to manually adjust accounting \nrecords for accrued payroll cost so that financial reports are accurate.\nSharing inventory information among three internally developed systems cre-\nates more significant integration challenges. The CSMS will replace the legacy phone \nand retail store sales systems that generate updates to inventory levels and financial \ntransactions. In theory, the CSMS, SCM, and Tradeshow systems could share the \nsame underlying database, thus eliminating the need to export or import inventory \ndata among them. However, the SCM is a legacy system that RMO would prefer to \nleave untouched during development of the Tradeshow System and CSMS.\nNote the two-way arrow between the SCM system and the CSMS in \n\u00ad\nFigure\u00a07-20. Both systems read and update inventory records and need current \nand accurate data. So which system \u201cowns\u201d inventory records? The answer is \nthat they both do, and that answer implies that the systems should share real-\ntime access to common data. But implementing that solution would require \nthe new CSMS to use the legacy SCM system\u2019s database. Though that solution \nis technically feasible, it forces new application software to interface with an \nolder DBMS, which may limit some desired capabilities of the CSMS. Also, \nwhat about noninventory data used by the CSMS? Will the SCM database be \nexpanded to include that data or will the CSMS access two different databases?\nRMO management is reluctant to create too many dependencies between \nnew and old systems. Thus, they\u2019ve decided to use a separate database to sup-\nport the CSMS. No changes will be made to the SCM, which will continue to \nuse its current database. Those decisions force a choice concerning inventory \ndata. One of the systems must be declared the system of record for inventory \ndata. A system of record maintains a master copy of data that is correct and \ncurrent. Any other system that maintains a copy of the same data must periodi-\ncally synchronize it with the system of record.\nFigure 7-21 shows the detailed impact of declaring the CSMS to be the sys-\ntem of record for inventory data. CSMS developers will create a Web service that \nimports and exports information about inventory data for the CSMS database. \nThe Web service format will enable updates over the Internet and provide future \nextensibility. The Web service will push data updates to the databases for the \nother two systems and copy any updates from those systems back to the CSMS \nsystem of record\u2003 a system or application \ncomponent that maintains the current and \ncorrect master copy of one or more data items\nFigure 7-21 RMO inventory data \nsynchronization\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The Tradeshow System accepts inventory level updates nightly and sends \nback any new inventory item records created by RMO buyers. Updates to/from \nthe CSMS and SCM system are more frequent because current data is more criti-\ncal to both systems. The SCM system processes product shipments from vendors, \nand the CSMS needs to know of them quickly so that customers see inventory as \nit becomes available, and so that shipments for current orders and back orders can \nbe quickly generated. The SCM needs frequent updates of inventory levels due to \nsales and shipments so that it can generate timely reorders from vendors.\nchapter Summary\nThis chapter described early activities that bridge the \ngap between systems analysis activities and detailed \ndesign activities, such as user-interface design, data-\nbase design, and internal design of software compo-\nnents. Those bridge activities include describing the \nsystem environment and designing its application \ncomponents. Describing the system\u2019s environment re-\nquires describing its technical architecture and any \ninterfaces with other systems. Designing the applica-\ntion components requires allocating system functions \nto components, describing how data is shared among \nthose components, and describing how the application \ncomponents are distributed across the technical \narchitecture.\nDiagrams developed during these design activities \ninclude locations, network, and deployment diagrams. \nLocation diagrams are customized maps that show the \nphysical locations of users and computing devices. Net-\nwork diagrams show computing devices and the networks \nthat connect them. Network diagrams can be annotated in \nvarious ways, including callouts that show embedded soft-\nware components and protocols.

Except for the interface to software and data \non mobile phones, the server-side portions of the system \nare a relatively traditional business-oriented application \nthat can be implemented by using old-fashioned tech-\nnology. What makes the RTGM system \u201cnew\u201d are its \nclient-side functions, including the automated collection \nof glucose levels, the regular transmission of that data \nto servers, the integration of communication between \npatients and health-care providers, and the integration \nof those functions within software installed on a por-\ntable device that can be carried in a user\u2019s pocket.\nWith that in mind, answer the following ques-\ntions. You may need to do some additional research to \nfully address them.\n\t\n1.\tShould the client-side software be deployed as \na browser-based application or as an installable \napp? Be sure to consider such issues as client/\nserver communication requirements and fre-\nquency, user-interface quality, and portability \nacross devices and operation systems.\n\t\n2.\tWhich (if any) social networking capabilities \nmight make a useful addition to the RTGM sys-\ntem? Be sure to consider the HIPAA requirements \ndescribed for this case at the end of Chapter 6.\n\t\n3.\tWhen recorded glucose levels generate high-\npriority alerts, physicians or other health-care \nproviders initiate direct contact with the patient. \nAn ordinary phone call over the cellular phone \nnetwork is one way to support direct contact. \nBecause any client-side device used with the \nRTGM system must be fully Internet-capable, an \nInternet telephony application, such as Skype, is \nanother possible way of supporting synchronous \nvoice or video communication with the patient. \nShould Skype or a similar Internet telephony \napplication be used with the RTGM system? \nWhy or why not? If such an application is used, \nshould it support video? Why or why not?\n\t\n4.\tData mining is an increasingly important tech-\nnique for medical research. The ability to scan \nmedical records of large numbers of patients over \nextended time periods enables researchers to bet-\nter evaluate the effectiveness of drugs and thera-\npies, more accurately connect disease risk levels \nto specific patient characteristics, and identify \npatterns of transmission or occurrence, progres-\nsion, and treatment response for rare diseases \nand conditions. What types of medical research \nmight be enabled or better supported by the data \ncollected by the RTGM system? Would your \nanswer change if the database were extended \nto include additional information that might be \ngathered from the patient\u2019s mobile phone (e.g., \nlocation information when each glucose level was \ncaptured, size and content of the patient\u2019s contact \nlist, call history, and the volume of text messages \nand Internet browsing activity)?\nRefer to earlier chapters for the functional details of \nthis application.

{"text": "218\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Overview\nIn Chapter 6, you learned that user-interface design is one of the activities of the \nfourth core process, design system components. In actuality, designing the user \ninterface has characteristics of both analysis activities and design activities.\nAs an analysis activity, user-interface design requires very heavy user \ninvolvement. You saw a good example of this in the chapter opening case. Screen \nlayout is a discovery activity and produces deep understanding of the user pro-\ncesses and needs just like other analysis activities. During the analysis activities, \ndevelopers discuss inputs and outputs early and often with system stakeholders \nto identify users and actors and the information they need to carry out their \nbusiness processes. In the following sections, you will learn different ways to \nthink about and to model the user interface to help yourself and the user con-\nsider various methods of interacting with the new system.\nAs a design activity, user-interface design utilizes other analysis models as \ninput, such as the system sequence diagram. It also produces models in the form \nof sample layouts that are used by programmers to implement the final system. \nBecause few systems operate autonomously or in isolation, designing the inter-\nfaces (inputs and outputs) between a system and its users is an important sys-\ntems design task. Poorly designed interfaces with people can result in a system \nthat operates less than optimally or doesn\u2019t fulfill its purpose. In this chapter, \nOpening case\u2002 Interface Design at Aviation Electronics\nBob Crain was admiring the user interface for the manu-\nfacturing support system that was recently installed at \nAviation Electronics (AE). Bob is the plant manager for \nAE\u2019s Midwest manufacturing facility, which produces \naviation devices used in commercial aircraft. These avia-\ntion devices provide guidance and control functions for \nflight crews, and they provide the latest safety and secu-\nrity features that pilots need when flying commercial \naircraft.\nThe manufacturing support system is used for all \nfacets of the manufacturing process, including product \nplanning, purchasing, parts inventory, quality control, \n\u00ad\nfinished goods inventory, and distribution. Bob was \nextensively involved in the development of the system \nfor several years, including the initial planning and devel-\nopment. The information systems team that developed \nthe system relied heavily on Bob\u2019s expertise. That was \nthe easy part for Bob.\nWhat particularly pleased Bob was the final user \ninterface. He had insisted that the development team \nconsider the entire user experience from the very begin-\nning. He didn\u2019t want just another cookie-cutter transac-\ntion processing system. He wanted a system that acted \nas a partner in the manufacturing process\u2014similar to \nthe way that AE\u2019s guidance and control system inter-\nfaces acted as a pilot\u2019s partner.\nThe first manager assigned to the project placed a \nlow priority on user-interface design. When Bob asked \nwhy user-interface design wasn\u2019t a key focus of early \niterations, the manager replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll add the user \ninterface later, after we work out the internal func-\ntions.\u201d When Bob insisted that the project manager be \nreplaced, the Information Systems Department sent \nSara Robinson to lead the project.\nSara had a completely different attitude; she started \nout by asking about events that affect the manufacturing \nprocess and about cases where users needed support \nfrom the system. Bob and Sara conducted meetings to \ninvolve users in discussions about how they might use \nthe system, even asking users to act out the roles of the \nuser and the system in carrying on interactions.\nAt other meetings, Sara presented sketches of \nscreens and asked users to draw on them to indicate the \ninformation they wanted to see and options they wanted \nto be able to select. These sessions produced many \nideas. For example, it appeared that many users didn\u2019t \nsit at their desks all day; they needed larger and more \ngraphic displays they could see from across the room. \nMany users needed to refer to several displays, and they \nneeded to be able to read them simultaneously. Users \nmade sketches showing how the manufacturing pro-\ncess actually worked, and the team used these sketches \nto define much of the interface. Sara and her team kept \ncoming back every month or so with more examples to \nshow, asking for more suggestions.\nWhen the system was finally completed and \ninstalled, most users already knew how to use it \nbecause they had been so involved in its design.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "219\nCHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\nyou will learn concepts and techniques that will assist you in designing screens \nand reports that are rich, engaging, and efficient\u2014elements that create a user-\nfriendly and effective interface.\nUser-interface design is much more complex than it used to be, even just \na few years ago. Users are doing much more with multiple computing devices. \nUser-interface design was initially only concerned with the layout of screens and \nreports. Today, you must consider the entire user experience\u2014what devices are \nbeing used and what the users are doing on those devices. Designing the user \ninterface is dependent not only on the type of device, such as desktop, laptop, \ntablet, or smartphone, but also on the specific types of devices that are being \nused, such as Apple or Android or Windows devices and operating systems. In \nthis chapter, you will learn general guidelines and principles that can be applied \nacross all user-interface and user-experience design.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Understanding the User Experience and  \nthe User Interface\nThe use of computing devices and applications continues to proliferate into all \naspects of our lives. Does the use of these applications make us more knowledge-\nable or more empowered? Or do they make our lives more complex with added \nfrustrations? The answer to these questions depends not only on the functional-\nity provided, but also on how easy it is to understand and use these applications. \nAs a developer, you must have a deep understanding of users, applications, \ndevices, techniques, and principles to build effective user interfaces.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Definitions\nThe user experience (UX) is a broad concept that applies to all aspects of a \nperson\u2019s interaction with a product or service. When the product is a software \napplication, UX includes actions, responses, perceptions, and feelings that a per-\nson has when he uses or anticipates using the software application. It is impor-\ntant for designers to think about the overall user experience as they consider the \ndesign of the new system and particularly the user interface.\nThe user interface (UI) is the set of inputs and outputs that directly involve \nan application user. It is the part of the system that the user sees and interacts with. \nBecause the user interface is the only part of the system that the users see, to them \nthe user interface is the system. UI design varies widely depending on such factors \nas interface purpose, user characteristics, and characteristics of a specific interface \ndevice. For example, although all user interfaces should be designed for maximal \nease of use, other considerations, such as operational efficiency, may be impor-\ntant for internal users who can be trained to use a specific interface optimized \nfor a specific hardware device (e.g., a keyboard, a mouse, and a large high-resolu-\ntion display). In contrast, a quite different user interface might be designed for a \n\u00ad\ncustomer-accessible system that assumes a cell phone as the input/output device.\nSometimes developers think the user interface can be developed and added \nto the system near the end of the development process, but as noted in the open-\ning case, the user interface is much more important than that. The user interface \nis a major element in the total user experience. Both the considerations related \nto the user experience and the details of the user interface must be integrated \ninto all elements of the system development.

Design techniques that embody this point of view are collectively \ncalled user-centered design, which emphasizes three important principles:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFocus early and throughout the project on the users and their work.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEvaluate all designs to ensure usability.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUse iterative development.\nAn early focus on users and their work is consistent with the approach to \nsystems analysis in this text. User-oriented analysis and design tasks are per-\nformed as early as possible and are often given higher priority than other tasks. \nFor example, such user-oriented analysis tasks as stakeholder identification and \ninterviews occur early in the project. User interfaces are designed in early itera-\ntions, and user-related design decisions drive other design decisions and tasks.\nThe second principle of user-centered design is to evaluate designs to ensure \nusability. Usability refers to how easy a system is to learn and use. Ensuring \nusability isn\u2019t easy; there are many different types of users with different prefer-\nences and skills. If the system has a variety of end users, how can the designer \nbe sure that the interface will work well for all of them? For example, if it is too \nflexible, some end users might feel lost. On the other hand, if the interface is too \nrigid, some users will be frustrated.\nFurthermore, ease of learning and ease of use are often in conflict. For \nexample, menu-based applications with multiple forms, many dialog boxes, \nand extensive prompts and instructions are easy to learn; indeed, they are self-\nexplanatory. Easy-to-learn interfaces are appropriate for systems that end users \nuse infrequently. But if internal users use the system all day, it is important to \nmake the interface fast and flexible, with shortcuts, hot keys, voice commands, \nand information-intensive screens. This second interface might be harder to \nlearn, but it will be easier to use after it is learned.\nuser-centered design\u2003 design techniques \nthat embody the view that the user interface \nappears to be the entire system\nusability\u2003 the degree to which a system is \neasy to learn and use\nFigure 8-1 Elements affecting the user experience\nEquipment\u2014Screen, keyboard,\nmouse, keypad, printed forms,\ndocuments, reports, webcam,\ndesk, chair, light\nScreen elements\u2014Windows,\nscreens, menus, buttons, pictures,\nanimations, fonts, sounds, colors\nApplication\u2014Functions,\norganization, screen content,\nadvertisements, distractions,\nlinks, views, complexities\nMobile equipment\u2014Touch\nscreen, screen size, brightness,\nresolution, hotspots, connections,\nresponse times\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

After each iteration, the project team evaluates the work \non the system to date. Iterative development keeps the focus on the user by con-\ntinually returning to the user requirements during each iteration and by evaluat-\ning the system after each iteration.\nJakob Nielson, Donald Norman, and Bruce Tognazzini (see Further \nResources) are active researchers in human-computer interaction (HCI), a \nfield of study concerned with the efficiency and effectiveness of user interfaces \nto computer systems, human-oriented input and output technology, and the psy-\nchological aspects of user interfaces. HCI is a broad field with many closely \nrelated fields of study, including interaction design, efficiency, ergonomics, soci-\netal impacts, psychological influences, and so forth.\nAlthough the actual computing devices that people use are physical enti-\nties, the items that appear on the screens are virtual entities. They exist only as \nimages and sounds. Because of this, it is helpful for HCI developers to use meta-\nphors based on real-world physical entities and actions to design a user interface \nwith a positive user experience.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Metaphors for Human-Computer Interaction\nTo make computers easier to use and learn, designers of early visually oriented \ninterfaces adopted metaphors, which are analogies between features of the user \ninterface and aspects of physical reality that users are familiar with. Metaphors \nare still widely applied to user-interface design, as described in Figure 8-2.\nFigure 8-3 is a screen capture of a computer running Windows that illus-\ntrates the direct manipulation, desktop, and document metaphors.

{"text": "223\nCHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Fundamental Principles of User-Interface Design\nMany information technology (IT) researchers and practitioners have published \narticles, books, and Web sites that offer guidance in user-interface design. Many \nof these guidelines are accepted best practices, having been around for decades. \nHowever, the proliferation of new applications, a variety of computing devices, \nand innovative ways to communicate has required new approaches and prin-\nciples for user-interface design.\nThis section provides explanations of some of the most important universal \nguidelines. It is organized into six major categories: human-interface objects, \nconsistency, discoverability, closure, readability and navigation, and usability \nand efficiency.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Human-Interface Objects\nHuman-interface objects (HIOs) are those objects that appear on a screen \nthat the user can manipulate. Included are such things as documents, buttons, \nmenus, folders, and icons. The following sections discuss several important \nprinciples that apply to the design and utility of human-interface objects.\n\u275a\n\u275aUse Human-Interface Objects That Reflect Their  \nPurpose or Behavior (Affordance)\nThe use of HIOs is very common in almost all of today\u2019s applications. The most \ncommon ones we are familiar with are buttons or other small icons. In new ver-\nsions of the Microsoft Office suite, the ribbons of icons at the top of the page are \na good example of useful HIOs whose appearance reflects their function. The \ntechnical term for this characteristic is called affordance. Affordance means \nthat the appearance of a specific control suggests its function\u2014that is, the pur-\npose for which the control is used. For example, a control that looks like a steer-\ning wheel suggests that it is used for turning. Affordance can also be achieved \nby a user-interface control that the user is familiar with in another context. For \nexample, the media player control icons shown in Figure 8-5 were first widely \nused on audiotape and videotape players and are still used in such devices as \nDVD and portable music players. They are widely incorporated into computer \ninterfaces because so many users are familiar with them. Notice in the figure \nthat a tool tip is provided. Tool tips are brief instructions that appear when the \nmouse hovers over a particular tool.\n\u275a\n\u275aHIOs Should Provide Visual Feedback When Activated\nA second and related characteristic is that HIOs should provide immediate feed-\nback when activated or receiving focus. Visibility means that a control is visible \nso users know it is available; it also means that the control provides immediate \nfeedback to indicate that it is responding. Feedback is some visual or audio \nresponse by the system in response to some user action. Figure 8-5 is also an \nexample of visibility and feedback. The controls are always visible at the bot-\ntom of the window and show immediate feedback on mouseover or mouse click. \nhuman-interface objects (HIOs)\u2003 icons \nand other objects on a screen that can be \nmanipulated by the user and cause some \naction to occur\naffordance\u2003 when the appearance of a \n\u00ad\nspecific control suggests its function\ntool tip\u2003 brief instructions that pop up when \nthe mouse hovers over a control\nvisibility\u2003 when a control is visible so that \nusers know it is available\nfeedback\u2003 some visual or audio response by \nthe system in response to a user action\nFigure 8-5 Example of affordance \nin media player controls\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "224\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nAnother example of visibility and feedback is shown in Figure 8-6, with a group \nof radio buttons and a check box. A group of radio buttons is a control that \nallows one item to be selected out of the group. A group of check boxes is a con-\ntrol that allows none or many items to be selected. As a radio button is selected, \nnot only does it change its color, but the image also immediately changes. An \neffective HIO performs some visible action when the mouse hovers over it. It \nperforms some other visible action when it is clicked or double-clicked.\nFeedback provides the user with a sense of confirmation and the feeling that \na system is responsive and functioning correctly. Lack of feedback leaves the \n \nuser wondering whether a command or input was recognized or whether the\u00a0sys-\ntem is malfunctioning.\nVisibility and affordance are relatively easy to achieve when the design tar-\nget is a commonly used platform, such as an iPad, a cell phone running the \nAndroid operating system, or a PC running Windows. Such platforms have well-\ndefined user-interface design guidelines and a library of user-interface features \nand functions that can be reused by application software.\nWeb user-interface design is less standardized. In some cases, a new icon is \nused and it is just expected that the user will become familiar with it. Often, these \nicons are only recognized because of trial and error. Two examples come to mind. \nThe small gear icon has been used to represent settings or options. Another icon, \nthree small bars, is also used. The attempt is to look like a drop-down menu, \nbut it took users a long while to recognize it as a metaphor for settings. Another \ndifficult example is the matrix of small squares to represent applications. This is \nfound on the Google account page. Many users still don\u2019t recognize its purpose.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Consistency\nConsistency can be applied to many different aspects of the user interface, as well as \nto the application itself. The effectiveness of the user experience is highly dependent \non consistency. Users not only expect consistency across the various screens of an \napplication, but now also anticipate consistency across applications. The following \nsections itemize different levels or areas where consistency should be maintained.\nradio buttons\u2003 a group of selection items \nthat allows only one item to be selected \nwithin the group\ncheck boxes\u2003 a group of selection items \nthat allows either none or many items to be \nselected within the group\nFigure 8-6 Example of visibility \nand feedback\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "225\nCHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\n\u275a\n\u275aConsistency Within and Across Platforms\nConsistency within a platform is usually fairly achievable because the tools to \nbuild applications and the libraries of existing icons are common and available for \nall developers. For example, when building Windows applications, it is common \nto use the standard icons, buttons, check boxes, and other user-interface icons.\nHowever, it is more difficult for developers to achieve consistency across \nplatforms. For desktop computers, there three common operating environments: \nWindows, Apple, and UNIX. For smaller mobile devices, there are several dif-\nferent environments, including Android, Windows, Apple, and BlackBerry. \nWeb browsers that execute across multiple platforms help bring consistency \nto \u00ad\nWeb-based applications, but they do not solve the problem completely. It is \nalways a challenge for developers who have cross-platform applications to make \nthe user interface as consistent as possible for cross-platform users.\n\u275a\n\u275aConsistency Within a Suite of Applications\nMany software organizations have developed and sell a suite of related applica-\ntions. In many instances, these applications were developed by separate develop-\nment teams with little communication between teams. The result, of course, is \nthat the user interface for each application has components, and maybe even the \nentire interface, that are distinct for each application. Organizations that provide \na suite should have a coordination group to ensure consistency within the suite.\nThe Microsoft Office suite is a good example of consistency within the \nsuite. Originally, only the three main components of the suite (Word, Excel, and \n\u00ad\nPowerPoint) had similar user interfaces. However, as Microsoft has acquired other \napplications and moved them into the suite, it has modified the user interfaces to be \nconsistent. For example, Access, Visio, and Project are not part of the basic suite, \nbut the user interface on these applications now has a consistent look and feel with \nthe ribbon bar across the top and common icons within the ribbon. Figure 8-7 \nshows the menu ribbon for three Microsoft applications: Visio, Excel, and Word.\n\u275a\n\u275aConsistency Within an Application\nSurprisingly, this concept is probably one of the most violated among developers. \nConsistency in using the same standard HIOs is quite easily achieved. They are \nprovided in standard libraries. However, when designing such interface items as \ninput forms or data display screens, it is easy to design inconsistent screens. For \nexample, a developer or developers may use different font types, sizes, colors, \nor bolding for labels and data fields. This may not confuse the user, but it does \nresult in an inconsistent user interface and looks unprofessional.\n\u275a\n\u275aConsistency Versus Continuity\nThis concept refers to changes occurring in new releases of an application. \nAlmost every application will have upgrade after upgrade with new versions \nFigure 8-7 Three Microsoft \napplications showing the menu \nribbon\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The problem designers have \nis understanding how to add new functionality while maintaining continuity \nacross new releases. It may not be possible to maintain complete consistency \nwhile adding new functions, but continuity should be maintained so that users \ncan easily transition into the new release.\nOne example that many of us are familiar with was the change from \n\u00ad\nWindows 7 to Windows 8. In this instance, Microsoft wanted to introduce new \naspects of Windows to be more compatible with mobile devices. Unfortunately, \nthey ignored continuity and eliminated many aspects that users were familiar \nwith. Microsoft did a quick fix of some of those issued with Windows 8.1, and \nin Windows 10 brought back even more of the traditional layout, icons, and \nfunctions of earlier versions. \u00ad\nFigure 8-8 shows the change from Windows 7 to \nWindows 8 on the basic home screen.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Discoverability\nMany applications have more features than can be shown on the initial user \ninterface, especially on smaller devices.

{"text": "227\nCHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\nOne option is to have a limited number of icons, but have all items listed in the \nmenu hierarchy. However, even that approach does not work in all cases. Some-\ntimes it is necessary to have functions or features that exist underneath the \n\u00ad\ninitial user interface and must be discovered. Discoverability is that feature of \nthe user interface that provides clues to help the users uncover hidden features. \nIt is important that developers consider the discoverability aspect of user- \ninterface design.\nOne example of features that are not visible or obvious are all the opera-\ntions that can be performed using the boundary and title bar of a window in \nWindows 8.1. The only ways to learn about these features is to either watch a \ntutorial video or to learn by trial and error. For example, moving the window \nwith the title bar to an edge causes it to snap to full size. Another example is \nclosing a metro-style app in Windows 8. To close these full-screen apps, the user \nmust grab the top of the app and pull it to the bottom of the screen. This feature \nwas not obvious, and in fact took many users quite a while to figure it out.\n\u275a\n\u275aUse Active Discovery to Help Find Hidden Features\nActive discovery is a user-interface feature that leads users into discovering \nhidden features. There are several methods a designer can use to implement \nactive discovery. One approach is to have a pop-up window appear at applica-\ntion initiation that provides hints and additional features. Another approach is \nto have a small text box appear as the user hovers over different locations of the \nscreen. This technique is best implemented with a slight delay so that the user is \nnot continually being distracted by the opening and closing of myriad text boxes.\nOne technique of active discovery used by the Microsoft Office suite is the \ngrouping of similar icons within the ribbon. In the lower-right corner of each \ngroup is a small arrow, which indicates that there are more features and func-\ntions available. This small clue helps the users find the additional features that \nare not as visible.\nFigure 8-9 returns to the DVD player controls to show these techniques. \nNotice that some controls are visible, but other controls are hidden. The \nmost important controls are on the main window and are visible and accessi-\nble. However, there are icons that open pop-up windows with less-frequently \nused controls. The tool tips, which appear on mouseover, are also a form of \nactive discovery.\ndiscoverability\u2003 a feature of the user \ninterface that provides clues to help the users \nuncover hidden features\nactive discovery\u2003 a user-interface feature \nto lead users to discover hidden features\nFigure 8-9 DVD player with \nhidden controls and tool tips  \nactive discovery\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "228\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u275a\n\u275aUse Visual Diagrams to Help Users Discover Functions or Tools\nThis third guideline is related to the Help feature of an application. When the user \ncannot find a desired feature on the user interface, she will sometimes resort to the \nF1 key or the Help function. Unfortunately, some applications are becoming less \nuser-friendly in this arena. Because most devices are now connected to the Internet, \noften the F1 key will connect to a server and display the general-purpose Help Web \nsite. In most cases, a user only wants a quick answer to a simple question. A\u00a0small \npop-up window with some instruction or a \u00ad\ndiagram is still the best solution.\nA powerful way to answer a quick query is with a small diagram that dis-\nplays what action to take. Figure 8-10 shows a simple diagram that is very \nexpressive of how to perform a desired action.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Closure\nThe idea of closure is based on the dialogue metaphor that was discussed ear-\nlier. In most cases, especially for organizational procedures, a use case requires \nseveral steps to complete. Sometimes this requires multiple screens; sometimes it \ncan be done with a single screen. In either event, the user interface should have a \nclearly defined beginning and ending.\n\u275a\n\u275aProvide Closure on Dialogues\nClosure is related to the concept of visibility and feedback discussed ear-\nlier. Feedback provided on the HIOs is one technique used to provide closure. \n\u00ad\nHowever, feedback on an individual HIO does not necessarily imply closure. \nFor example, a Save button may change colors and make a clicking sound when \nit is clicked. However, to ensure closure, it is helpful to have a message pop up \nsaying that the work was saved or the action was completed. The same prin-\nciple applies to a Cancel button. The Cancel button should provide visual and \naudio feedback, but refreshing the data fields on a cancel action provides a more \ndeclarative closure.\nWhen a use case requires several steps, it is important that the user know \nthat all the steps are completed. One technique to implement this process is to \nhave a Continue button and a Finish button that indicate the end of the process. \nSometimes a progress bar is also included and a final message to indicate that \nthe dialogue has successfully finished. Refreshing the final screen to return to a \nbeginning point of the next dialogue also indicates closure.\n\u275a\n\u275aProtect Users\u2019 Work\nIt would appear that the principle to protect a user\u2019s work is absolute. However, \nit applies to a broader set of circumstances than many developers consider. It is \ncommon with current applications to always ask the user if she wants to save her \nwork before closing the application. Many applications will also do automatic \nFigure 8-10 Help window with diagrammatic explanation\nSwipe left or right\nto browse a book\nSwipe up or down\nto read a book\nTap the control to\naccess a function\nDouble-tap the\ncontrol to toggle\non and off\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Another common feature is to inform \nthe user when she tries to save a newer version of a file on top of an older one. \nThese are effective techniques.\nHowever, how many of us have filled out an online form and had to start \nover again because of either an error or the need to change an input value on \nthe original form? For example, when purchasing concert tickets or airline res-\nervations, if you only want to change a date or time, often the application will \nrequire you to complete the entire form for every change. That approach does \nnot conform to the principle of saving the user\u2019s work. As much as possible, the \nuser interface should capture and remember the data entered by the user.\n\u275a\n\u275aMake Actions Reversible (Undo)\nUsers always make mistakes and often need to undo a recent step. Both the \napplication and the user interface must support this reverse function. Users need \nto feel that they can explore options and take actions that can be canceled or \nreversed without difficulty. This is one way that users learn about the system\u2014\nthat is, by experimenting. It is also a way to prevent errors; as users recognize \nthey have made a mistake, they cancel the action. In addition, designers should \nbe sure to include Cancel buttons on all dialog boxes and allow users to go back \na step at any time. Finally, when the user deletes something substantial\u2014a file, \na record, or a transaction\u2014the system should ask the user to confirm the action \nand, where possible, delay implementing the action.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Readability and Navigation\nThe concept of readability and navigation are particularly important today, yet \ncan be difficult to support. Though large desktop screens usually are quite read-\nable, readability with small mobile devices is often a serious problem. Large \ndesktop screens also have a lot of space for clues about navigating through vari-\nous screens of an application. The small screens on mobile devices often require \nthat the navigation tools be hidden or partially hidden.\n\u275a\n\u275aText Should Be Readable (Type, Size, and Color)\nThere are two primary considerations when designing text to be displayed: the \nage of your target population and the devices that will be used. Older popula-\ntions normally require large fonts with clear distinction from the background. \nSmaller mobile devices limit the amount of text that can reasonably be displayed, \nso both the type of font and the organization of the text are important. One help-\nful consideration is that the actual data to be displayed is more important than \nthe labels. Of course, the data must be labeled sufficiently to be understood, but \nthe actual transfer of information occurs with the changing data, not the labels.\nThe font type is also important. Fancy fonts are frequently hard to discern. \nSimple sans-serif fonts tend to be better for online reading. Figure 8-11 illus-\ntrates some of the issues with trying to be too fancy with fonts. This Web site \nadvertisement is way too busy. The font colors on the blue background make \nsome parts almost impossible to read. The fancy script lettering is also very \n\u00ad\ndifficult to read.\n\u275a\n\u275aNavigation Should Be Clear\nNavigation through an application or a Web site depends heavily on the orga-\nnization of the user interface. The user interface can be organized in a deeply \nhierarchical vertical fashion or a shallow approach with a flat horizontal span \nof forms or pages. The vertical approach has fewer menu items at the top level, \nbut requires multiple levels of submenus. The horizontal approach has many \nmenu items at the top level and fewer levels of submenus. The organization of \n \nthe application or Web site is then reflected in the menu hierarchy provided. \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "230\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nEither approach works. Each has advantages and disadvantages. Generally, \nflat designs allow users to see more options quickly. However, deeper menu \nhierarchies often allow a more organized search approach. In the \u201cdepth ver-\nsus breadth\u201d design, the most important issue is balance. Grouping the various \noptions in logical categories also helps users find their way through the site.\nMobile devices present a challenging platform. Due to the limited screen \nsize, it is often not possible to show all the navigation options. Often the naviga-\ntion objects are semihidden and must be retrieved to navigate to another page \nor form.\n\u275a\n\u275aAlways Allow a Way Out\nThis concept applies both to navigation through an application and doing work \nwithin a particular page or form. When the user is entering data, he should be able \nto immediately escape from that form or page without changing the system. Many \ninput forms have a Cancel button to immediately back out of the specific form.\nOne common technique to allow the user to navigate back out of a loca-\ntion within an application is to display breadcrumbs on the page. Breadcrumbs \n(navigation) is the technique of displaying the sequence of pages traversed to \nthe current page. For example, RMOHome> Women\u2019s clothes> WinterCoats \nindicates that the user has traversed three levels down to the winter coats page. \nEach item in the list is a hot link that will take the user back to that location. \nThis provides both a view of the navigation path and a way to immediately back \nout and return to any previous level.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Usability and Efficiency\nOne of the primary design considerations in UI design is how to increase user \nefficiency and effectiveness. In other words, the entire user experience must be \nconsidered to make an application effective and usable.

{"text": "231\nCHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\n\u275a\n\u275aProvide Shortcut Keys to Support Experienced Users\nSoftware applications normally must be prepared to support users at many \ndifferent levels of competency and training. Novice users need clear naviga-\ntion through sequences of steps to complete a task. More advanced users want \nto complete a task in the fewest steps possible. Hence, user interfaces must be \ndesigned to support users across a wide range of capability and expertise.\nUser interfaces designed primarily for novices are often an annoyance and \nan impediment to experienced users\u2019 productivity. Users who work with an \napplication repeatedly or for long time periods want shortcuts for frequently \nused functions, which minimize the number of keystrokes, mouse clicks, and \nmenu selections required to complete tasks. Examples include voice commands \nas well as shortcut keys, such as Windows keyboard sequences Ctrl+C for \ncopy and Ctrl+V for paste. It is always a good idea for application designers \nto include standard shortcuts when available or build their own for frequently \nrepeated functions.\n\u275a\n\u275aDesign Error Messages That Provide Solution Options\nA good user-interface design anticipates common errors and helps the user to \navoid them or correct them immediately when they occur. One way to do this is \nto limit available options, presenting the user with only valid options for a spe-\ncific point in a dialogue. Adequate feedback, as discussed previously, also helps \nreduce errors.\nWhen the system does find an error, the error message should state specifi-\ncally what is wrong and explain how to correct it. Consider this error message \nthat occurs after a user has typed in a full screen of information about a new \ncustomer:\nThe customer information entered is not valid. Try again.\nThis message doesn\u2019t explain what is wrong or tell the user what to do next. \nFurthermore, what if the system clears the data-entry form after this message \nappears? The user would have to reenter everything previously typed but would still \nhave no idea what was wrong. A better error message would read more like this:\nThe date of birth entered is not valid. Check to be sure only numeric \n\u00ad\ncharacters in appropriate ranges are entered in the Date of Birth field.\nThe system also should streamline corrective actions. For example, if the \nuser enters an invalid customer ID, the system should tell the user that this has \noccurred and then place the insertion point back in the Customer ID text box.\n\u275a\n\u275aDesign for Simplicity\nThe final point is the basic KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle. The simpler \nthe user interface, the better the user experience will be. Fewer mouse clicks \nis always more productive. Fewer levels to navigate through increase speed of \naccess. Straightforward paths to highly used forms or pages is best. Developers \nshould always be asking themselves whether there is a simpler way to design the \nnavigation and the screens.\nFigure 8-12 shows the home page displayed when a customer views the \nRMO Web site. The form includes two menu bars near the top that group \nrelated functions within the same part of the page. If the user points to Shop \nfor Clothing, a submenu is displayed immediately below the menu item and the \nmenu text \u201cShop for Clothing\u201d changes to white text with a blue background. \nLabels for the menu items are widely spaced in an easy-to-read font. Except \nfor the logo and picture, the page uses a few complementary colors. The title is \npositioned near the top of the picture in bold letters. A portion of the title can be \nseen from behind the drop-down menus.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

{"text": "232\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Transitioning from Analysis to User-Interface Design\nThe foundation for user-interface design is built from the use case definitions \nas described in Chapter 3. You learned in earlier chapters how to document the \ninteractions between the user and the system using use case descriptions, activ-\nity diagrams, and most importantly system sequence diagrams. Most use cases \nrequire direct user interaction and become the starting point for a dialogue or \nform. Use cases usually require the user to input choices and data into the sys-\ntem (such as when making an online order) or may generate outputs in response \nto a user request (such as when tracking a shipment).\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Use Cases and the Menu Hierarchy\nMenus provide the mechanisms first to organize use cases and second to invoke \na particular use case or user dialogue. In all but the smallest systems, menus \nare needed to present the user with a number of choices per screen, to group \nrelated functions together so users can more easily locate them, and to properly \nsequence related forms to handle complex procedures. Figure 8-13 shows two \ndifferent menu styles. In Figure 8-13(a), the mouse pointer is positioned over the \nShop item of the upper menu in a Web page. Figure 8-13(b) shows a more com-\nplex menu design, with three menu levels displayed.\nHow does a designer decide which use cases and user interfaces to include, \nwhich menus are required, and how many menu levels are required? These deci-\nsions are driven both by organization of the menus (flat versus deep), by the \nnumber of uses cases or menu choices, and by the limits of human cognition. \nFor a typical business system, dividing the total number of interactive use cases \nby five provides an initial estimate of the number of menus needed that includes \nall use cases and allows for additional menu items, such as setting options or \npreferences.\nUse cases with common actors and event decomposition or that implement \nCRUD actions for a specific domain class are good candidates to be grouped \ninto a single menu or related group of menus. For example, consider the RMO \nCSMS use cases shown in Figure 8-14. An initial grouping of these cases by \nactor and subsystem is a good starting point for menu design.\nFigure 8-12 RMO home page \nshowing simple design and \nnavigation\nSource: Microsoft Corporation\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Each menu collects uses cases from one subsystem for a customer or \ninternal sales representative. The number of menu choices ranges from four to \nseven, which won\u2019t overload any one menu and may enable multiple menu levels \nto be displayed at one time. A dialogue design is created for each menu option. \nYou should note that designers often discover missing or incomplete use cases \nduring user-interface design, which results in a brief return to analysis activities \nto complete the documentation.\nMenus also include options that are not activities or use cases from the event \nlist. Many of these options are related to the system controls, such as account \nmaintenance or database backup and recovery, which are discussed later in this \nchapter. Other added items include help links as well as links to other menus \n \nor subsystems.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Analysis Models and Input Forms\nIn Chapter 5, you learned how to document the process flow of a use case using \nan activity diagram or a system sequence diagram.

It might be possible to design the three input \nscreens and use those same screens to display the output of the same fields after \nthe system updates internal files. These kinds of decisions are exactly the ones \nthat need to be made during user-interface design.\nLet\u2019s develop a first draft of an input screen for createNewCustomer \n(name, phones, emails). The first step is to verify the data that is passed. The \nplace to verify the data is to look at the domain model, to see the attributes of \nthe appropriate classes. Observing the domain model (see Figure 4-25), you \ncan see that there are four fields that require input: name, mobilePhone, home-\nPhone, and emailAddress. Notice that there are two other classes, Address \nand Account, that will also be used to verify data for the other \u00ad\nmessages in \nthis use case.\nFigure 8-17 illustrates the first draft of the customer screen. It appears that \nthis screen, with some additional messages and buttons, can be used both for \ninputting data and for displaying the data as it exists within the system.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Dialogues and Storyboards\nAfter identifying all required dialogues, the designers must document the dia-\nlogues. One approach is to list the key steps the dialogue incorporates, fol-\nlowed by a description of what the user and computer do at each step. The \nformat for writing these steps can mimic the activity diagram described in \nChapter 2 or the use case description format in Chapter 4, or it can be more \nfree form.\nDesigners can also document dialogue designs by writing out how the user \nand system might interact if they were two people engaged in conversation. \nSometimes, the designer can go right from building a dialogue to sketching a \nseries of screens that make the design more understandable. Consider the Check \nout shopping cart use case for the RMO CSMS.

{"text": "238\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nAs you begin the design of the user interface, there are three major consid-\nerations that will affect your approach. The first decision, which was probably \nmade at the beginning of the project, is whether the application will be built as \na custom, stand-alone software application or whether it will be browser-based. \nEither approach is viable whether the application is a local, single-computer \napplication or whether it runs over a network or the Internet. If the software is \na stand-alone application, then it will utilize the controls and human-interface \nobjects that are available in development libraries for that platform. If it is a \nbrowser-based application, then it will need to conform to the controls and con-\nfigurations provided by the browsers. In some rare instances, the software may \nneed to support both environments.\nThe second major decision applies to the type of device the application is \ndesigned for. Some applications are designed to run only on desktops and lap-\ntops. Others execute on tablets, while others are designed exclusively to execute \non small devices such as smartphones. In some cases, the software may need to \nrun on multiple devices. In fact, for many types of software, it is desirable that \nit can be executed on several types of devices. Obviously, this complicates the \ndesign of the user interface.\nThe third major decision applies to the operating system platform. For desk-\ntops and laptop computers, the most common operating systems are Windows, \nApple Mac OS, and a UNIX derivation such as Ubuntu. For tablets, there are \nWindows 8 and Windows RT, Apple iOS, Google Android, Amazon Fire, and \nothers such as Ubuntu and BlackBerry. For smartphones, the major operating \nsystems are Google Android, Apple iOS, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, and oth-\ners. This decision affects the design because the human-interface objects that are \navailable are different for each platform, especially for stand-alone applications. \nFor Web-based applications, there is a little more commonality, but the browsers \nare still slightly different for each platform.\nAs with the fundamental principles, the range of topics for this section is \nimmense. You are encouraged to extend your knowledge of specific platforms \nthrough additional books, tutorials, and articles.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Desktop and Laptop User Interfaces\nThere are three areas that will be discussed here with regard to user-interface \ndesign: layout and formatting, data entry, and navigation and visibility.\n\u275a\n\u275aLayout and Formatting\nUsually, desktops and laptops have large screen displays with adequate space to \nprovide a rich and engaging user interface. Here are several important guidelines:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDesign screens with purpose. Each screen should have a primary purpose \nor use. Do not clutter the screen with unnecessary elements. Allow empty \nspaces, sometimes called white space, on the screen to keep it simple and \neasily readable.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nConsider location and grouping. Users in the United States read screens top \nto bottom, left to right. Place important items where they are easily found. \nMake logical groupings of related items and place them closer together.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEnsure professionalism. Make sure that when people see the screen it looks \nprofessional. Align and organize screen objects. Check for poor grammar \nand spelling errors. Make sure lists have equivalent language constructs \n(nouns or verbs or adjectives\u2014always the same form).\nFigure 8-19 illustrates a sloppy design of an input form with inconsistent labels, \ninconsistent text box types, poor spacing, misspelled words, and so forth. How \nwould you like to have to fill out data on this form? How would you like to have \nyour name associated with the design of this form?\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "239\nCHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\n\u275a\n\u275aData Entry\nScreens and pages where users enter information require special attention. The \noverriding objective on data-entry screens is always to minimize errors. The design \nof the screen can have a big influence on whether the data is error free or error \nladen. Errors not only reduce productivity, but also can compound errors when \nthe data is used for later processes. There are many ways to make beautiful, effec-\ntive data input screens. Here are some things to consider as you design the screens:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUse controls that minimize keystrokes. Use controls that do not require \nkeystrokes. List boxes with predefined fields allow quick selection of cor-\nrect data. Date controls where the user can select a date controls entering \ncorrect date and format. Autocorrect fields can also help ensure correct \ndata. Use check boxes and radio boxes when possible. Though these types \nof controls can reduce productivity, they do minimize errors.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSet focus and tabbing. Set the cursor in the first data-entry box so it is \nready to accept data. Make sure the cursor tabs from field to field in a \n\u00ad\nlogical fashion.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSet font and text box sizes appropriately. Set font sizes for both labels and \nentered text so that it is easy for the user to read. Set the size of the data-\nentry box so that the use of scroll bars is minimized. It is difficult to enter \nlong sentences into a small text box that requires scrolling to view what \nwas entered.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nInclude online edits. The user interface can be developed to simply accept \nthe entered information, or program code can also be associated with cer-\ntain fields to perform validations immediately. Some edits are simply logi-\ncal and can be made locally. Other edits may require validation against a \ndatabase, and it may not be feasible to perform those edits until the screen \nis submitted. In any event, it is always best to edit the newly entered data as \nthoroughly as possible and as soon as feasible.\nFigure 8-20 shows a product search screen for RMO. This screen allows the \nuser to search for products using key words and other criteria such as type of \nproducts, price ranges, gender, and catalog. In the search group on the lower \nright, the user can use a text box to enter data. There is also a list box, which \ndisplays a drop-down list of predefined values by clicking on the arrow. A \ncombo box is a variation of list box that also allows the user to enter new values \n \nif necessary. Contrast this form with Figure 8-19.\n\u275a\n\u275aNavigation and Visibility\nWhen designing for navigation and visibility, the developer must consider not \njust each screen individually, but the entire application or site. A good site design \nconsiders primary as well as secondary paths through the various screens, \nincluding both forward and backward movement. Desktop systems should have \nadequate screen space to allow for clear positioning of menus, hot links, and \nbuttons that are easily located.\ntext box\u2003 a box that accepts text from a \nkeyboard or speech input\nlist box\u2003 a text box with a list of predefined \ndata values\ncombo box\u2003 a combination text box and list \nbox that displays a predefined list, but also \nallows data entry\nFigure 8-19 Poorly designed \ndata-entry fields\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "241\nCHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\nimages and videos are commonly sent to application pages. However, developers \nstill need to be aware of file sizes and page load times. Users may be willing to \nwait for a video to begin, but they still prefer rapid responses for the initial load. \nFurthermore, developers should include sufficient error-handling capability to \nreestablish the dialogue if the connection breaks.\nThe second major issue is that all the pages of the Web site need to be com-\npatible with all of the potential browsers. The most common browsers today \nare Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Each of the major browsers \nimplements the primary controls in a somewhat similar fashion. However, each \nalso has unique extensions. Developers must carefully design and thoroughly \ntest Web pages so that they display correctly in each environment. This could \nrequire either using controls that are common to all browsers, or testing to see \nwhich browser is being used and transmitting the appropriate user-interface \ncode. Here are some additional considerations for design of a Web user interface.\n\u275a\n\u275aLayout and Formatting\nAs a topic, the layout and formatting of Web pages is extensive. It is impossible \nto address even a small portion of the issues, guidelines, standards, and conven-\ntions that apply to Web user-interface design. Developers who become expert in \nthis arena have a program of continual self-education, reading, and training to \ndesign beautiful, engaging, and effective Web pages.\nWeb applications will be displayed in many different-sized windows. Win-\ndows will also frequently be resized on the computer screen. Careful consid-\neration should be given to what happens to the page as it is resized within the \nwindow. Poorly designed pages may not resize correctly and may require hori-\nzontal scroll bars to view the entire page. Although vertical scrolling is accept-\nable for most applications, horizontal scrolling is not.\nThere is one common business practice that user-interface designers con-\ntinually struggle with: advertising on a Web site. Because the business model \nfor many Web applications includes a revenue string from advertising, designers \nfrequently have to find some way to include sponsor ads. As designers, we will \nnot be able to eliminate all advertising. However, it is a good design practice to \nplace the advertising so that it does not confuse or override the main purpose of \nthe page. This, of course, requires a balance between the revenue stream from \nthe main function of the Web pages and the advertising revenue stream.\nIn contrast to integrated advertising, Figure 8-22 is a Web site of only \nadvertisements. It was an interesting marketing idea, but very difficult for any \nkind of use.\n\u275a\n\u275aData Entry and User Actions\nData entry for Web applications has all the same considerations as for regular \ndesktop apps. With the advent of such capabilities as client-side programming \nwith asynchronous transmission to the server, data-entry validation can occur \nimmediately as it is entered. A primary consideration for data entry is error han-\ndling when delays occur over the network.\n\u275a\n\u275aNavigation and Visibility\nStandards and conventions for Web applications are in a continual state of flux. \nHorizontal menu navigation using tabs along the top of the page are currently a \npopular and effective technique. The guidelines discussed earlier for navigation \nand visibility also apply to Web applications. It is especially important that navi-\ngation links be checked periodically. Web applications frequently have hot links \nto external sites, which are more susceptible to being broken.\nFigure 8-23 is a draft design for the RMO checkout page. Tasks are clear \nwith easily discernable organization and clear instructions. There is plenty of \nwhite space to allow for additional instructions or navigation elements if needed.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "243\nCHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\nthe earlier principles you learned about multilayer design are not as important \nfor building a smartphone app interface.\nThe principles you will learn in this section apply to creating a smartphone \napplication. However, all smartphones also have browser programs and thus sup-\nport Web-based applications. We won\u2019t discuss them separately, but the same prin-\nciples of effective smartphone app user interfaces apply to the design of Web pages \nviewed on smartphone browsers. Today, all Web-based applications should test \nthe platform that is requesting the page so that it can respond with the appropri-\nate page layout and information. This characteristic is called mobile \u00ad\nresponsive \ndesign. Trying to display a full-bodied Web page on the limited real estate available \non a smartphone screen almost always ends up completely unusable.\nTwo primary characteristics of smartphones that influence every aspect of \nuser-interface design are the limited screen size touch screen interaction. Design-\ning for these two characteristics requires a major shift in thinking. Limited \nscreen size dictates that applications and user interfaces must be simple and \nfocused. In addition, almost all navigation and interaction must fit on and be \ndone through the screen. Smartphones have a very limited repertoire of hard-\nware-based buttons and controls, unlike a desktop with a keyboard that has \nfunction keys and shortcuts as well as a mouse pointer. However, phone interac-\ntion is also changing as voice interaction becomes more common.\n\u275a\n\u275aLayout and Formatting\nGiven the characteristics of smartphone environment, there are several items \naffecting layout and formatting that should be noted:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEach screen should have a single focus or purpose.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nScreens need both portrait- and landscape-view capabilities.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWhen appropriate, screens should be allowed to resize without losing \nscreen controls.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nScreen components should be directly touch-manipulated.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nVisible navigation controls should be placed at the bottom of the screen.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDue to screen swiping, both horizontal and vertical scrolling is allowed.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUse small pop-up screens when additional information is needed.\nFigure 8-24 illustrates some of the issues related to smartphone apps. \n \nThere is always an important tradeoff between the work area of the screen, and \nthe navigation elements. In this case, two types of navigation elements are used. \nThe icons will take the user to entirely different pages within the application. \nThe control buttons at the bottom will take the user to the specific functions \nwithin the same page. The \u201cEdit\u201d label is a hotlink that will drop down other \nmenu items to allow the user to perform actions on the work area. Thus, even \nthough \u201cEdit\u201d is visible, it contains hidden functions, which requires that the \nuser must pursue active discovery to find all the available actions. It may take \nthe user some time and effort to utilize this smartphone app fully.\n\u275a\n\u275aData Entry and User Actions\nThe limited nature of smartphone screens makes data entry and other user \nactions sometimes difficult to support. Input can occur by typing on a touch \nkeyboard, swiping on the same keyboard, speaking, or other kinds of touching \nor tapping. Output can be in the form of text, buzzes, beeps, clicks, ring tones, \nvideo movies, songs, and vibrations. In other words, smartphone outputs are \nrich and varied. Smartphone apps should support multiple types of inputs and \noutputs to take advantage of the capabilities built in to the device. When allow-\ning touch screen actions, developers should plan for the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nBe aware of \u201cfat finger\u201d problems where users cannot precisely touch parts \nof the screen. This means that important control areas should not be too \nsmall nor too close together.\nmobile responsive\u2003 designing Web sites \nso that the pages are responsive to being \ndisplayed on small, mobile devices\nFigure 8-24 Android smartphone \nwith app\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Confirm all actions that delete data.\n\u275a\n\u275aNavigation and Visibility\nNavigation and visibility are major issues for smartphone user-interface design. \nIt is generally impossible to keep all navigation controls visible at all times. \nDevelopers must pay particular attention to making the application user-friendly \nin this area of design. Here are a few suggested guidelines:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDesign the landing screen (first loading screen) so that it shows clearly how \nthe app is organized and how to get to all the functions. Include a way to \nreturn to this screen on all other screens.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDesign the user interface so that there are visual clues for where a task is \nlocated in the app.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nConsider using an action bar at the bottom (or top) of every screen with \ncommon navigation or action controls. If the bar must be hidden, make it \neasy to find and show.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nRemember that there is no mouseover capability, so such techniques as tool \ntips are not available.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEnsure a Back button capability exists, either on the device or as part of the \napplication.\nFigure 8-25 is the landing screen for the RMO smartphone app. This screen \nis almost completely made up of navigation elements to send the user to the \nappropriate screens. The only image is the small logo at the top. Special atten-\ntion was given to contrast and layout to ensure readability.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Tablets\nUser-interface design for tablets requires many of the same techniques that are \nused for smartphone design. Tablets are mobile devices with similar device con-\nstraints as smartphones. The primary difference is that there is more screen real \nestate, so the screen constraints are not as tight.\nWhen considering layout and formatting for tablets, applications must sup-\nport both portrait and landscape display. Where a smartphone screen can only \nsupport a single function or activity, it may be possible to have multiple action \nareas on a tablet. The small screen size and the lack of physical keyboards and \nmouse interaction do require that developers still design screen layout carefully.\naction bar\u2003 a common navigation bar with \naction controls used for smartphones and \n\u00ad\nusually placed at the bottom of the screen\nFigure 8-25 RMO home screen \non a smartphone\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "245\nCHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\nData entry and user actions are very similar for tablets and smartphones. \nThe lack of a keyboard makes typing somewhat cumbersome, so any tech-\nnique that reduces actual data entry is helpful. The larger touch screen, how-\never, does permit the use of larger icons and touch areas to alleviate the fat \nfinger problem.\nProbably the biggest benefit of the somewhat larger screen is that more naviga-\ntion controls and menu items can be made visible and remain on the screen. More \nitems can be added to the action bar, and having navigation controls other than \nthe single action bar is possible. Figure 8-26 is a picture of an iPad with an online \nstore open. The navigation is clear, with a menu on the top and icons for the avail-\nable categories. Note, however, that the site limits this page to eight categories.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Designing Reports, Statements, and  \nTurnaround Documents\nDue to the highly interactive nature of today\u2019s software applications, there is \nless need for printing formal reports. In many cases, the screen views that the \nuser sees can either be sent directly to the printer, or a special print view is pro-\nvided. A print view is usually a simple reformatting of the screen view with the \ncontrols, advertising, and extraneous graphics removed. As you work with the \nusers to develop an application, you should continually be asking if a print view \nis required for each screen that displays information or whether a printed report \nis the best form for presenting the information.\nModern information systems have made information much more widely \navailable, with a proliferation of all types of reports\u2014paper and electronic. One \nof the major challenges organizations face today is to compile the overwhelming \namount of information available to support managerial decision making. One \nof the most difficult aspects of output design is to decide what information to \nprovide and how to present it effectively.\nFigure 8-26 Application on an \niPad tablet\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

These contain specific information on business trans-\nactions\u2014for example, a list of all overdue accounts, with each line of the \nreport presenting information about a particular account.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSummary reports. These are often used to recap periodic activity. An \nexample of this is a daily or weekly summary of all sales transactions, with \na total dollar amount of sales. Managers often use this type of report to \ntrack departmental or division performance.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nException reports. These provide details or summary information about \ntransactions or operating results that fall outside of a predefined range of \nvalues. When business is progressing normally, no report is needed. For \nexample, a manufacturing organization might produce a report that lists \nparts that fail quality control tests more than 0.2 percent of the time.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nExecutive reports.

A primary characteristic of electronic report-\ning is that it must be dynamic; users should be able to control input to meet \nthe specific needs of a particular situation. For example, an electronic report \ncan provide links to further information. One technique, called drill down, \nallows the user to activate a \u201chot spot hyperlink\u201d on the report, which tells \nthe system to display a lower-level report that provides more detailed infor-\nmation. For example, \u00ad\nFigure 8-30 contains a monthly sales summary. The \nreport provides sales totals grouped by product category and season. If the \nuser clicks the hot link for any season, a detailed report pops up with more \nsales data.\nAnother variation of this hot link capability lets the user correlate informa-\ntion from one report to related information in another report. Most people are \nfamiliar with hot links from using their Internet browsers. In an electronic report, \nhot links can open other information that correlates or extends the primary infor-\nmation. This capability can be very useful in a business report that, for example, \nlinks the annual statements of key companies in a certain industry.\nAnother aspect of electronic reports is the capability to view the data from \ndifferent perspectives. For example, it might be beneficial to view sales com-\nmission data by region, by sales manager, by product line, or by time period \ndrill down\u2003 user-interface design technique \nthat enables a user to select summary \ninformation and view supporting detail\nFigure 8-30 RMO summary report with drill down to the detailed report\nMonthly Sales Summary\nYear      2015\nMonth\nJanuary\nCategory\nSeason\nWeb\nTelephone\nMail\nTotal\n  Code\nSales\n  Sales\nSales\nSales\nFootwear\nAll\n$      289,323\n$  1,347,878\n$     540,883\n$    2,178,084\nMen\u2019s Clothing\nSpring\n$   1,768,454\n$  2,879,243\n$     437,874\n$    4,691,484\nSummer\n        213,938\n387,121\n       123,590\n         724,649\nFall\n        142,823\n       129,873\n       112,234\n         384,930\nWinter\n     2,980,489\n    6,453,896\n       675,290\n    10,109,675\nAll\n     1,839,729\n4,897,235\n       349,234\n      7,086,198\nTotals\n$   6,945,433\n$14,747,368\n$  1,698,222\n$  23,391,023\nWomen\u2019s\nSpring\n       387,432\n$     454,329\n$     123,849\n         965,610\nClothing\nSummer\n         89,322\n       187,987\n         34,879\n         312,188\nFall\n         78,398\n         99,873\n         56,890\n         235,161\nWinter\n       782,982\n       899,490\n       278,389\n      1,960,861\nAll\n       778,394\n       678,987\n       328,122\n      1,785,503\nTotals\n$  2,116,528\n$  2,320,666\n$     822,129\n$    3,359,323\n782,9\n2,982\n       899,490\n90\n       278,389\n      1,960,861\n1\n77\n778,394\n       678,9\n8,987\n       328,122\n22\n      1,785,\n,50\n503\n116,528\n$  2,3\n,320,666\n$     822\n2 1\n,129\n$    3,35\n359,323\nMonthly Sales Detail\nYear      2015      Month      January      Category      Men\u2019s Clothing      Season     Winter\nProduct\nProduct\nWeb\nTelephone\nMail\nTotal\n     ID\nDescription\nSales\n   Sales\nSales\nSales\nRMO12987\nWinter Parka\n$ 1,490,245\n $  3,226,948\n $  337,640\n$   5,054,833\nRMO13788\nFur-Lined Gloves\n      149,022\n        322,695\n       33,765\n        505,482\nRMO23788\nWool Sweater\n      596,097\n     1,290,775\n     135,058\n     2,021,930\nRMO12980\nLong Underwear\n      298,050\n        645,339\n       68,556\n     1,003,005\nRMO32998\nFleece-Lined Jacket        447,075\n     1,258,079\n     100,271\n     1,805,425\nTotal\n$ 2,980,489\n $  6,743,836\n $  675,290\n$ 10,394,615\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "251\nCHAPTER 8 \u25a0 Designing the User Interface\nChapter Summary\nThe primary focus of user-interface design is on the us-\ner\u2019s needs, requiring major involvement by the user. As \nsuch, user-interface design has characteristics of both \nanalysis and design activities. Today\u2019s UI design efforts \nfocus on more than building the screens and reports, \nbut also considers the entire user experience. The use of \nvarious metaphors, such as direct manipulation, desk-\ntop, or dialogue metaphors, helps developers better un-\nderstand and think about how the users interact with \nthe system.\nUser-interface design is a complex discipline and \nusually requires substantial knowledge and experi-\nence to understand important influencing factors. Six \nkey factors to consider are human-interface objects, \nconsistency, discoverability, closure, readability and \nnavigation, and usability and efficiency. Each of these \ncategories has several key issues that need to be ad-\ndressed during design activities.\nInput for the user interface comes from the dia-\ngrams and models that were developed during the \nanalysis activities. The list of use cases is often helpful \nto define menus and navigation components. Activity \ndiagrams and system sequence diagrams help identify \nparticular screens and reports that are needed.\nA major difficulty of UI design is the many differ-\nent devices and screen types that must be supported, \nfrom large screen desktop systems to miniature smart-\nphone systems. In addition, many different platforms, \nsuch as Apple versus Android devices, require multiple \ninterfaces to display correctly on each device.\nAlthough output reports are not used as widely as they \nonce were, there is still the need to produce printed output \nof some information. Furthermore, today\u2019s printed reports \nneed to be more sophisticated by integrating charts and \ngraphs. Users expect sophisticated electronic reports with \nhot links, which allow drill down to display more detail.\ndiscoverability\ndocument metaphor\ndrill down\nexception reports\nexecutive reports\nfeedback\nhuman-computer interaction (HCI)\nhuman-interface objects (HIOs)\nlist box\nmetaphor\nmobile responsive\nradio button\nstoryboarding\nsummary reports\ntext box\ntool tip\nusability\nuser-centered design\nuser experience (UX)\nuser interface (UI)\nvisibility\n\t\n1.\tWhy is user-interface design often referred to as \ndialogue design?\n\t\n2.\tWhat are some examples of the physical, percep-\ntual, and conceptual aspects of the user interface?\n\t\n3.\tWhat are the three metaphors used to describe \nhuman-computer interaction?\n\t\n4.\tA desktop on the screen is an example of which \nof the three metaphors used to describe human-\ncomputer interaction?\n\t\n5.\tWhat is the technique that shows a sequence of \nsketches of the display screen during a dialogue?\n\t\n6.\tWhat are some of the input controls that can be \nused to select an item from a list?\n\t\n7.\tWhat two types of input controls are included in \ngroups?\n\t\n8.\tWhat are the different considerations for output \nscreen design and output report design?\n\t\n9.\tWhat is meant by the user experience?

Realtors want \nto be able to create a new listing as soon as pos-\nsible so other realtors and potential buyers will find \nthe listing online. Some like to enter the informa-\ntion while talking with the owner or while inspect-\ning the property. Realtors are rarely in their offices \nthese days, so being able to create a new listing on \na mobile device is a key feature of the Multiple List-\ning Service system.\nConsider the information that must be entered \nwhen creating a new listing, and list the dialogue steps \nthat are necessary. Keep in mind that when designing \nfor a smartphone, less information can be entered in \neach step compared with a full screen Web application.\nAlso keep in mind that typing is error-prone and \nawkward for many users, so think about opportunities \nto use check boxes, radio buttons, and list boxes to \naid selection. Create a storyboard of this use case for a \nmobile device, showing each step of the dialogue that \nmaximizes the use of check boxes, radio buttons, and \nlist boxes.\nRunning Case Studies\nDevelop a storyboard that encompasses the following sam-\nple dialogue.

But the social networking \nsubsystem can also play an important role in resort \nsecurity. For example, each resort could use traveler \nlocation, interests, activities, and \u201clikes\u201d\u2014all of which \nare available through the application\u2014to monitor \nthe well-being of travelers staying at the resort. Most \nspring break travelers are young, and their parents are \nconcerned about their safety\u2014particularly at isolated \nresorts in foreign countries. SBRU and the participat-\ning resorts could keep track of where travelers are and \nwho they are near, monitor messages about activities \nand parties, and anticipate crowded conditions or \nvulnerable travelers wandering off-site. Alerts could \nnotify security if conditions veer away from normal or \nif messages indicate there are problems. For example, if \n \nthe pool is overcrowded, some action can be taken. \nIf messages refer to places off-site that are known \nto be dangerous, security can make an extra patrol. \nAlthough many people find this use of private infor-\nmation objectionable, others\u2014particularly parents\u2014\nfind it essential.\nImagine resort security with a large, wide-screen \nmonitor tracking traveler activities. Design a main \nscreen that includes multiple locations, paths and \nroads, traveler location and status, messages traveling \nfrom traveler to traveler, and other features that secu-\nrity should monitor. Create a storyboard that shows \nan example of a pop-up alert and a menu of options \nthat security might select after an alert. Should you \nalso show security the staff members\u2019 locations and \nstatus? How about clicking security staff members to \nsend them a message? How about clicking a location \nto turn up the lights or to close a security gate? Be \ncreative as you think through the design possibilities. \nYou should include four or five screen layouts for the \nstoryboard.\nSandia Medical Devices Real-Time Glucose Monitoring\ndeem applicable, such as GPS tracking, map and direc-\ntions software, and real-time updates of pickup loca-\ntions. Consider the possibility that the driver may \nwant to get an overview of his or her stops for the \nentire run, view the next few stops, or just get direc-\ntions to the next stop.\nIn Chapter 3, you learned about a use case where the \npatients would like to view their history. In Chapter\u00a05, \nwe called the use case View history. Here are those \nparagraphs:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nViewing and interpreting data and trends. Patients \nwant to be able to view more than their current \nglucose level. They would like the ability to see \npast glucose levels over various time periods, with \na specific focus on time periods during which \ntheir glucose was inside and outside of acceptable \nranges. A graphical view of the data is preferred, \nalthough some patients also want to be able to see \nactual numbers.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEntering additional data. Some patients want to \nbe able to enter text notes or voice messages to \nsupplement glucose level data. For example, pa-\ntients who see a high glucose alert might record \nvoice messages describing how they feel or what \nthey had recently eaten. Some patients thought \nthat sharing such information with their health-\ncare providers might be valuable, but others only \nwanted such information for themselves.\nYou have been asked to write a smartphone app to \ndisplay this history. The smartphone app would con-\nnect to the monitor using Bluetooth and collect the pre-\nvious 24 hours\u2019 data. Using a drawing program such \nas Visio or PowerPoint, sketch out the screen to view \nthis history. Explain your screen(s) and controls\u2014how \nthey work and what they mean.

Almost every facet of our lives depends on databases. \nDatabases underlie everyday activities, including making a phone call, search-\ning the Web, reading your e-mail, buying groceries, visiting your doctor, and \ntweeting your favorite friends. Database management systems let database \ndesigners, developers, and end users create databases and store, retrieve, and \nmanage the data. Sharing and managing the vast amounts of data needed by \na modern organization wouldn\u2019t be possible without a database management \nsystem.\nIn Chapter 5, you learned to construct a domain model class diagram. The \nclass diagram is the starting point for database development. To design and \nbuild an information system, developers must transform conceptual models into \nmore detailed design models. In this chapter, you will learn how to transform \nthe domain model class diagram into a detailed database model and how to \nimplement that model with a database management system.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Databases and Database Management Systems\nA database (DB) is an integrated collection of stored data that is centrally \nmanaged and controlled. A database typically stores information about dozens \nor hundreds of classes or entities. A database is managed and controlled by \na database management system (DBMS). A DBMS is a system software \ncomponent that is generally purchased and installed separately from other \nsystem software components (e.g., operating systems). Examples of modern \ndatabase management systems include Microsoft SQL ServerTM, Oracle, and \nMySQLTM.\nOpening case\u2002 Downslope Ski Company: A New Production Database\nDownslope Ski Company manufactures skis and snow-\nboards. In the company\u2019s early years, ski manufacturing \nwas simple and straightforward. However, in recent years, \nmanufacturing has become more complex with high-tech \nmaterials, such as carbon-laced resins, and product fea-\ntures, such as skis with integrated bindings. To ensure \nproduct quality, computers now control production pro-\ncesses, including ingredient mixtures, furnace tempera-\ntures, and curing times. These changes have gone hand \nin hand with increased attention to raw materials quality.\nDownslope uses a just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing \nprocess, which means that it doesn\u2019t stockpile a large \nquantity of raw materials. It keeps about a 10-day supply \non hand and depends on its suppliers to restock materi-\nals at least weekly. As with many growing companies, \ntheir software systems have lagged behind changes \nin the manufacturing process. Downslope is currently \nupdating its manufacturing control system. Critical issues \nin the new system include the database and accessibility \nof its information to all the interested parties.\nNathan Jones wants to get a good grasp of the over-\nall database requirements before proceeding with the \ndesign for the first iteration development. There are sev-\neral areas he wants to review, including data sources, \ndestinations, and formats; data requirements for every \nstep in the manufacturing process; requirements for his-\ntorical data; data size and volume; database response \ntime requirements; and so forth.\nInput data sources and formats are especially impor-\ntant because suppliers need access to inventory levels, \nincluding both items that are in production and supplies \nthat are on order. They also need to update the data-\nbase for deliveries and billing. Other priorities include \ncapturing and storing data from production furnaces and \nmanufacturing equipment, including periodic outputs of \nvolumes, temperatures, and times. Of course, produc-\ntion staff need access to the database to control pro-\nduction and to forecast future needs. Finally, sales staff \nare interested in product levels and delivery dates for \nfinished inventory. The inputs and outputs range from \nWeb-based access, to automated equipment feeds, to \ninternal user access.

Usually when \nwe refer to a database, we mean both the database data, shown on the left, \nand the DBMS, shown in the middle. The database data consists of two related \ninformation stores: the application domain data, which is the actual data for \nthe problem domain, and the schema, which contains descriptive information \nabout the application domain data. The reason we usually include all of these \ncomponents when we discuss the database is that the application domain data \ncannot be accessed without the DBMS and the schema data. Hence, we consider \nit all together.\nThe schema data is required because it describes the structure and rules for \naccessing the application domain data. It is often referred to as metadata, or \ndata about the data. It includes the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nOrganization of individual stored data items into higher-level groups, such \nas tables\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAssociations among tables (e.g., pointers from customer objects to related \nsale objects)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDetails of individual data items, including types, lengths, locations, and \nindexing of data items\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAccess and content controls, including allowable values for specific data \nitems, value dependencies among multiple data items, and lists of users \nallowed to read or update data items\nA DBMS has four key components: an application programming interface \n(API), a direct SQL or query interface, an administrative interface, and an under-\nlying set of data-access programs and subroutines. Figure 9-1 refers to SQL, \nwhich stands for Structured Query Language SQL, as the query language \nused to access the database data. Application programs, users, and adminis-\ntrators never access the domain data directly. Instead, they tell an appropriate \nDBMS interface what data they need to read or write, using names defined in \nthe schema. The DBMS accesses the schema to verify that the requested data \nexist and that the requesting user has appropriate access privileges. If the request \nis valid, the DBMS extracts information about the physical organization of the \nrequested data from the schema and uses that information to access the domain \ndata on behalf of the requesting program or user.\nAdministration\ninterface\nDirect query\nuser\nDatabase\nadministrator\nAPI SQL\nprocessor\nDatabase Management\nSystem\nApplication\nprogram\nApplication\ndomain\ndata\nSchema\ndata\nDatabase Data\nDBMS control logic\nDirect SQL\nprocessor\nFigure 9-1 Database and DBMS \ncomponents with interacting actors\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nStructured Query Language SQL\u2003 a query \nlanguage used to access and update the data \nin a relational database\nschema\u2003 database component that contains \ndescriptive information about the data stored \nin the physical data store\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The most significant change has been the type of \nmodel used to represent and access the content of the physical data store. Early \nmodels, including the hierarchical and network models, have been replaced by \nthe relational and object-oriented (OO) models. However, though most modern \nsoftware is designed and implemented by using OO techniques and program-\nming languages, most deployed databases and DBMSs are based on the rela-\ntional model.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Database Design and Administration\nBefore jumping into the actual details of how to design the database, you first \nneed to address three important issues:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHow does database design integrate into the organization\u2019s overall techno-\nlogical environment?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHow does database design integrate into the overall project plan?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWho is involved in database design?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Technology Environment\nMost system development occurs within an organization that has an existing \ntechnology architecture and upgrade strategy. Included in the technology archi-\ntecture may be various DBMSs, databases, database servers, and networks. The \nfollowing sections first consider the software and data environment, and then \ndiscuss the hardware and server configurations.\n\u275a\n\u275aData and DBMS Environment\nIn most organizations, information systems and databases are deployed in a piece-\nmeal fashion, with new systems purchased or developed to meet specific business \nrequirements. The result, of course, is many independent systems with diverse data \nand DBMS configurations in one company. In addition, one of the most important \nassets of almost any organization is its data. Information such as client lists, prod-\nuct descriptions, and sales histories is critically important to the continued success \nof the organization. The development of a new information system, and especially \nthe database design, must capture and preserve this critical information. In other \nwords, the new database must incorporate the important data from the previous \ndatabases and systems. (Chapter 13 discusses issues related to the actual conver-\nsion of the data from the old database to the new database.)\nIn addition to replacing or upgrading existing data in the database itself, \nit is also common that the previous system also fed data to other information \nsystems in the organization. This same service will need to be reflected in the \ndesign of the new database. For example, a new inventory system may need to \nbe tightly coupled to a supply chain management system with data flowing in \nboth directions between the two databases.\nThese issues become even more important, and more complex, when differ-\nent databases are residing on different DBMSs. Data transfer between DBMSs is \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

Each DBMS has its own rules and idiosyncrasies with regard to \ndata types, SQL extensions, user authentication and privileges, triggers, stored \nprocedures, and so forth.\n\u275a\n\u275aHardware and Network Architecture\nThe other big issue is the hardware and network configuration in the organiza-\ntion. An important issue is how the database architecture of the new system will \ninteract with the architecture that supports existing systems. More specific ques-\ntions include whether the new system will use existing DBMSs and \u00ad\nservers\u2014it is \npossible for a single DBMS or server to support multiple independent \u00ad\ndatabases\u2014\nand whether the existing servers and the network have sufficient unused capacity \nto support the new system. Those questions are typically asked and answered in \nan early project iteration or before the project is even approved.\nA beginning organization may only have a few desktop systems. However, \neven small organizations can have a local area network (LAN), which connects \ndesktop systems together and permits sharing of database information. Frequently, \nthe need for a new system and database is due to growth or anticipated growth. In \nthose cases, the network and computer server environment is changing and grow-\ning. Decisions about the deployment architecture should be made early in the proj-\nect and will have a big impact on database design decisions. Going from smallest \nto largest hardware architecture, databases can be deployed as the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nA single desktop system residing on one computer and used only by one or \ntwo users.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nA shared database that resides on a database server for a LAN. A database \nof this size can be accessed by all the users in a particular office or depart-\nment. A single server database might also be deployed over the Internet if it \nis accessed by a Web-based application.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nA larger database requiring multiple servers, but that is contained within \na single server farm or data center. This configuration requires a sophisti-\ncated switchboard function with decision and routing protocols to respond \nto queries and updates.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFinally, when the organization becomes global with many users worldwide \n(or in multiple locations in a single country), it is often required to have \nmultiple data centers or server farms. As you can imagine, this requires \nincredible sophistication to maintain current data among the various data \ncenters. Later in this chapter, you will learn about distributed databases \nthat exist in this configuration.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Project Plan and Schedule\nChoosing the correct timing for database design and construction within a \nsystem development project isn\u2019t a simple matter. The basic issue is whether \nthe database design can proceed in iterations or if it is better to complete the \ndatabase early in the project. In Chapter 1, you saw an example of an itera-\ntive approach to system development using Agile techniques. (You will learn \nmore about iterative development in Chapters 10 and 11.) The philosophy of an \niterative approach is to develop the system incrementally, including determin-\ning the processing requirements and mapping the classes of the domain model. \nBecause the primary input for database design is the domain model, an incre-\nmental development of the domain model dictates an incremental design of the \ndatabase. However, there exists a fundamental tension between Agile/iterative \ndevelopment and designing the complete database early. The foundation of any \ninformation system is the database, and having a stable database design facili-\ntates the development of the entire system.\nIterative development and phased deployment typically occur together in \ncurrent adaptive approaches to system development.

Phased deployment is normally implemented by deploying various subsys-\ntems one at a time until the entire system has been deployed. Database design is \ninfluenced by both of these techniques.\nNormally in iterative development, the higher-risk elements of a subsystem \nare developed first. Because the database is the foundation of any information \nsystem, it is common to define the domain model and perform the database \ndesign in the first few iterations of subsystem development. For example, rather \nthan focus on a detailed design of the user interface and on programming in the \nearly iterations, it is usually a better approach to expend time and resources to \ndiscover and validate all the classes and attributes of the domain model.\nUnfortunately, even this technique may not be sufficient for a complex sys-\ntem consisting of multiple subsystems with interlocking database requirements. \nFocusing only on a single subsystem within a set of iterations may not discover \nimportant database considerations influenced by the design of other subsystems \nnot yet in development. In a phased deployment, these other subsystems may \nnot be explored until the first subsystem has been deployed. Obviously, if major \nchanges to the database are required, the original deployment may need to be \nredone. There are no definitive directions to determine if the entire database \nmust be designed before any portion can be deployed. Experienced project man-\nagers and team members are sensitive to the risks associated with phased data-\nbase development and deployment.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Database Design Team\nLarger organizations typically have staff members dedicated to maintaining \nthe operational databases that underlie an organization\u2019s information systems. \nAlthough the project team has primary responsibility for defining the domain \nmodel and designing the corresponding database for a new system, permanent \ndatabase staff usually assist the project team in database design. This ensures con-\nsistency between database requirements for new and existing systems and helps to \navoid problems that might disrupt existing systems when a new system is deployed.\nTwo key positions on the permanent database staff are the data administra-\ntor and the database administrator. A data administrator (DA) has respon-\nsibility for the structure and integrity of the data itself. Specifically, the DA \nmanages important aspects of data definition and database design, including the \nfollowing:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nData standards. Naming standards, definition standards, data typing stan-\ndards, and value edits\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nData use.

{"text": "263\nCHAPTER 9 \u25a0 Designing the Database\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Relational Databases\nHistorically, many different structures have been used to organize data into a \ndatabase. Most early structures were either hierarchical or linked together in \nsome type of network. More recently, however, databases have been built in a \nrelational structure by defining a set of interconnected tables. The following sec-\ntion defines the terms and concepts of relational databases.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Definitions\nA relational database management system (RDBMS)  is a DBMS that orga-\nnizes stored data into structures called tables or relations. Relational database \ntables are similar to conventional tables; that is, they are two-dimensional data \nstructures of columns and rows. However, relational database terminology is \nsomewhat different from conventional table and file terminology. A single row \nof a table is called a row, tuple, or record, and a column of a table is called an \n\u00ad\nattribute or field. A single cell in a table is called an attribute value, field value, \nor data element. As indicated previously, the data in a relational database is \nedited and accessed through a common query language called Structured Query \nLanguage or SQL. You will learn how to use SQL in your database courses.\nFigure 9-3 shows the content of a table as displayed by the Microsoft Access \nrelational DBMS. Note that the first row of the table contains a list of attribute \nnames (column headings) and that the remaining rows contain a collection of \nattribute values, each of which describes a specific product. Each row contains \nthe same attributes in the same order, but not necessarily containing the same \nattribute values.\nFigure 9-2 Data and database \nadministrators\u2019 responsibilities\nApplication\ndomain\ndata\nDatabase Management\nSystem\nData administrator\n \n\u2022 Standard\n \n\u2022 Ownership\n \n\u2022 Quality\nDatabase administrator\n \n\u2022 Environment\n \n\u2022 Security/protection\n     \u2022 Performance\n \n\u2022 Recovery\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nrelational database management system \n(RDBMS)\u2003 a DBMS that organizes data in \ntables or relations\ntables\u2003 two-dimensional data structures \nconsisting of columns and rows\nrow\u2003 one horizontal group of data attribute \nvalues in a table\nattribute\u2003 one vertical group of data attri-\nbute values in a table\nattribute value\u2003 the value held in a single \ntable cell\nFigure 9-3 Partial display of a \nrelational database table\nSource: Microsoft Corporation\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "264\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nEach table in a relational database must have a unique key. A key is an \nattribute or set of attributes, the values of which occur only once in all the rows \nof the table. You learned about a key in Chapter 4 when you learned about \nobject classes. The key uniquely identifies each object in a class. For a relational \ndatabase table, the key uniquely identifies each row in the table. Frequently, \nthere may be multiple groups of attributes that are unique in each row and that \ncould serve as a candidate key. If there are multiple unique attributes or sets \nof attributes that are candidate keys, then the database designer must choose \none of the possible keys as the primary key. In any event, each table is given a \nprimary key.\nKey attributes may be natural or invented. An example of a natural key \nattribute in chemistry is the atomic weight of an element (a unique identifying \ncharacteristic) in a table containing descriptive data about elements. Unfor-\ntunately, in business, few natural key attributes are useful for information \nprocessing, so most key attributes in a relational database are invented. Your \nwallet contains many examples of invented keys, including your Social Secu-\nrity number, driver\u2019s license number, and credit card numbers. The key field is \nan important element because it is frequently used to find or locate a particu-\nlar row in a table. For example, in a driver\u2019s license system, using your driver\u2019s \nlicense number, your record can be retrieved with information about you and \nyour driving history.\nIn addition to serving as unique identifiers for each row, primary keys are \ncritical elements of relational database design because they are the basis for rep-\nresenting relationships among tables. Keys are the \u201cglue\u201d that binds rows of one \ntable to rows of another table\u2014in other words, keys relate tables to each other. \nFor example, consider the class diagram fragment from the RMO example, \nwhich is shown in Figure 9-4, and the tables that are shown in \u00ad\nFigure\u00a09-5. The \nclass diagram fragment shows an optional one-to-many association between the \nclasses ProductItem and InventoryItem. The upper table in Figure 9-5 contains \ndata representing the ProductItem class. The lower table contains data repre-\nsenting the InventoryItem class.\nThe association between the ProductItem and InventoryItem classes is rep-\nresented by a common attribute value within their respective tables. The Pro-\nductItemID attribute (the primary key of the ProductItem table) is stored within \nthe InventoryItem table, where it is called a foreign key. A foreign key is an \nattribute that duplicates the primary key of a different (or foreign) table. In \n\u00ad\nFigure\u00a09-4, the existence of the value 1244 as a foreign key within the Invento-\nryItem table indicates that the values of Vendor, Gender, and Description in the \nrow defined by the value 1244 of the ProductItem table also describe inventory \nitems 86779 through 86788.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Designing Relational Databases\nFor database design, the preferred starting point is the domain model \nclass diagram because it provides a comprehensive description of all the \nkey\u2003 an attribute or set of attributes, the \nvalues of which are unique for each row of the \ntable, that is used to uniquely identify a row\ncandidate key\u2003 an attribute or set of attri-\nbutes that are unique identifiers and could \nserve as the primary key\nprimary key\u2003 the key chosen by a database \ndesigner to define relationships by being used \nas a foreign key in other tables\nforeign key\u2003 an attribute that duplicates \nthe primary key of a different (or foreign) table\ngender\ndescription\nsupplier\nmanufacturer\npicture\nProductItem\n1\n0..*\nsize\ncolor\noptions\nquantityOnHand\naverageCost\nreorderQuantity\nInventoryItem\nFigure 9-4 Portion of the RMO \nclass diagram\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

For the moment, we will treat each group \nof generalized and specialized classes as if it were a single class. Thus, there \nare 12 primary classes that will be used to create tables. The attributes of each \ntable will be the same as those defined for the corresponding class in the class \ndiagram. To avoid confusion, table and attribute names should match the names \nused in the class diagram and abbreviations should be avoided. Initial table defi-\nnitions for the classes in Figure 9-6 are shown in Figure 9-7. This example uses \nthe same camel case naming convention that was used to name the attributes \nin the class diagram. However, there are other conventions that are popular in \nindustry. Some DBMSs allow attribute names with embedded spaces. Other \nconventions include using all lowercase letters with underscores.

The application program must \nthen retrieve that key for use in subsequent database operations. Embedding \nthis capability in the DBMS frees the Information Systems (IS) developer from \ndesigning and implementing customized key-creation software modules. In the \nexample of Figure 9-8, all the primary keys will be an AutoNumber type of field \nexcept the AccountNumber for the Customer table. An AccountNumber may be \nan AutoNumber field, but it might just as easily be a specific number assigned, \nbased on some other algorithm.\nInvented keys that aren\u2019t assigned by the information system or DBMS must \nbe carefully scrutinized to ascertain their uniqueness and usefulness over time. \nFor example, employee databases in the United States commonly use Social \nSecurity numbers as keys. Because the U.S. government has a strong interest in \nguaranteeing the uniqueness of Social Security numbers, the assumption that \nthey will always be unique seems safe. But will all employees who are stored \nin the database have a Social Security number? What if the company opens a \nmanufacturing facility in Asia or South America?\nInvented keys assigned by nongovernmental agencies deserve even more care-\nful scrutiny. For example, FedEx, UPS, and other shipping companies assign a \ntracking number to each shipment they process. Tracking numbers are guaran-\nteed to be unique at any given point in time, but are they guaranteed to be unique \nforever (i.e., are they ever reused)? Could reuse of a tracking number cause pri-\nmary key duplication in your database? And what would happen if two different \nshippers assigned the same tracking number to two different shipments?\nOrganizations that have large number of records in the database and that \nshare these items across multiple databases will sometimes use a globally unique \nidentifier (GUID). GUIDs are guaranteed to be unique across all items in the \nworld. However, because they are usually 32 hexadecimal digits in length, they \nrequire substantial storage space in the database, and are usually only used for \nspecific items that need to be uniquely identified outside of the database.\n\u275a\n\u275aRepresenting Associations\nAssociations are represented within a relational database by foreign keys. The \nchoice of which foreign keys to place in which tables depends on the type of \nassociation being represented. The RMO class diagram in Figure 9-6 contains \n10 one-to-many associations, two many-to-many associations, and two general-\nization/specialization association groups. You will deal with the generalization/\nspecialization associations in a later step. The rules for representing one-to-\nmany and many-to-many associations are as follows:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nOne-to-many associations. Add the primary key attribute(s) of the \u201cone\u201d \nclass to the table that represents the \u201cmany\u201d class.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMany-to-many associations. There are two possible situations\u2014either an asso-\nciation class has already been defined in the domain model and a table has been \ncreated, or a many-to-many association exists with no association class defined:\n\u25cf\n\u25cfAssociation with defined association class. Add the primary keys of the \nendpoint classes (i.e., the associated classes) as foreign keys in the table \nthat was created for the association class. These foreign keys are always a \ncandidate key and frequently will serve as the primary key. They uniquely \ndefine the rows in the association class table.\n\u25cf\n\u25cfAssociation without a class. Create a new table to represent the associa-\ntion. Add the primary keys of the endpoint classes (i.e., the associated \nclasses) as foreign keys in the new table. These foreign keys are always \na candidate key. The concatenation of these primary keys is always a \nunique identifier for the record and thus a candidate key. An invented \nprimary key may also be added if desired for ease of use.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

Each foreign \nkey (shown in italic) represents a single association between the table contain-\ning the foreign key and the table that uses that same key as its primary key. For \nexample, the attribute CustomerAccountNumber was added to the Sale table as \na foreign key representing the one-to-many association between the Customer \nand Sale classes. The foreign key SaleID was added to the SaleTransaction table \nto represent the one-to-many association between Sale and SaleTransaction.\nMany-to-Many Associations\u2003\nFigure 9-10 expands the table definitions in \n\u00ad\nFigure\u00a09-9 by updating the PromoOffering table to represent the many-to-\nmany association between Promotion and ProductItem. The primary key of \n\u00ad\nPromoOffering becomes the combination of PromotionID and ProductItemID. \nThe old primary key PromoOfferingID is discarded. The two attributes that \nmake up the primary key are also foreign keys and are displayed in boldface and \nitalic to indicate their dual status.

A similar situation \nexists for CartItem. However, ProductComment is different. Even though it has \none-to-many associations with ProductItem and Customer, it cannot be mod-\neled as an association class.

All \nthe non-key attributes in the InStoreSale, TelephoneSale, and OnlineSale classes \nare stored in the Sale table.

{"text": "273\nCHAPTER 9 \u25a0 Designing the Database\nA normalized relational database schema has three important characteristics:\n1.\t Allows flexibility in implementing future data model changes\n2.\t Contains a minimum of redundant data\n3.\t Prevents insertion, deletion, and update anomalies\nA database schema is considered flexible and maintainable if changes to the \ndatabase schema can be made with minimal disruption to existing data content \nand structure. For example, adding a new class to the schema shouldn\u2019t require \nredefining existing tables. Adding a new one-to-many association should only \nrequire adding new foreign keys and/or tables. Redundancy also plays a role in \ndatabase longevity and usability. Excessive redundancy reduces schema flexibility \nand also reduces system performance. Anomalies in record updates, insertions, and \ndeletions occur, for example, when deleting data in a table inadvertently deletes \nimportant but ancillary data. For example, if customer name and address informa-\ntion is maintained as part of a Sale, then deleting a Sale record might also com-\npletely delete the Customer information! Obviously, this is not a desirable result.\nYou have learned how to create a database schema based on a data modeling \nactivity rigorous enough to create a correct and complete data model. You have \nalso learned how to convert a conceptual data model to a relational model or rela-\ntional database schema. The advantage of creating a database schema using this \nprocess is that the resulting schema is already in normalized form. However, in \nyour career you will have occasion to work with databases that were not designed \nwith this rigorous data modeling approach or in which data modeling errors were \nmade, so you should understand how to evaluate and normalize a database.\nNormalization is a formal technique for structuring a database to minimize \ndata redundancy and to prevent data anomalies. It defines specific methods to \neliminate redundancy and improve flexibility as well as to prevent data anomalies. \nDatabase theory defines increasing levels of normalization, including first normal \nform, second normal form, third normal form, fourth normal form, Boyce-Codd \nnormal form, and others; however, a complete discussion of normalization is well \nbeyond the scope of this textbook. The following sections briefly define the key \nconcepts of first, second, and third normal forms. Usually ensuring that a data-\nbase is in third normal form is sufficient for most business information systems.\n\u275a\n\u275aFirst Normal Form\nA table is in first normal form (1NF) if every field contains only one value. \nThe formal way to state this is that all attribute values must be atomic. Non-\natomic fields can be illustrated in two ways. Either you have attributes with mul-\ntiple values in them, which are called multivalued attributes, or you have a table \nwith multiple columns with the same name. Figure 9-13(a) illustrates the first \napproach, and Figure 9-13(b) illustrates the second. 1NF prohibits attributes \nsuch as Dependent, which is shown in Figure 9-13.\nnormalization\u2003 a formal technique \nfor transforming a relational schema to \nan equivalent one that minimizes data \nredundancy and eliminates data anomalies\nfirst normal form (1NF)\u2003 a restriction that \nall fields must be atomic, or single valued\nFigure 9-13(a) Rows with \nmultivalued attribute Dependents\nSSN\n111-22-3333\n222-33-4444\n333-44-5555\nName\nMary Smith\nJose Pena\nFrank Collins\nDepartment\nAccounting\nMarketing\nProduction\nSalary\n40,000\n50,000\n---\n35,000\nDependents\nJohn, Alice, Dave\nJan, Julia\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nSSN\n111-22-3333\n222-33-4444\n333-44-5555\nName\nMary Smith\nJose Pena\nFrank Collins\nDepartment\nAccounting\nMarketing\nProduction\nSalary\n40,000\n50,000\n35,000\nDependent\nJohn\nJan\nDependent\nAlice\nJulia\nDependent\nDave\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nFigure 9-13(b) Rows \nwith varying number of \nDependent columns\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "274\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nTo correct this problem, the employee table must be divided into two \ntables. The first table will have the columns of SSN, Name, Department, and \nSalary. Another table, with a newly invented key, will have columns SSN and \nDependent. Notice in the second table, that each row has a unique key, and \nalso has a pairwise matching of SSNs and Dependents. Figure 9-14 illustrates \nthe solution to the problem. The schema shown in Figure 9-14 is in first nor-\nmal form.\nNote that the correct data model for this situation would be an Employee \nclass and a Dependent class with a one-to-many association. As stated pre-\nviously, a correct data model\u2014when converted to a set of database tables \n\u00ad\ncorrectly\u2014will result in a normalized schema.\n\u275a\n\u275aFunctional Dependency\nBefore moving on to second and third normal forms, you should become famil-\niar with the concept of a functional dependency. A functional dependency is \na relationship between columns such that the values in one (or more) column \ndetermine the values in a second column (or set of columns). The association is \nformally stated as follows:\nAttribute B is functionally dependent on attribute A if for each value \nof attribute A there is only one corresponding value of attribute B. Also \nwritten as FD: A S B.\nThe most precise way to determine whether functional dependency exists \nis to pick two attributes in a table and insert their names as A and B of the \nprevious statement and ask whether the result is true.

As long as the invented key \nProductItemID is guaranteed to be unique within the ProductItem table, then \nthe preceding statement is true. Therefore, Description is functionally dependent \non ProductItemID. Note that the following notation is another way to write a \nfunctional dependency \u201cFD: ProductItemID S Description.\u201d Said another way, \n\u00ad\nProductItemID functionally determines Description.\nLet\u2019s check other columns. Look at ProductItemID and Supplier. Note \nthat Supplier is also functionally dependent on ProductItemID, or FD: \nProductItemID\u00a0S Supplier. However, in this case, also notice that the reverse \nis not true. That Supplier does NOT functionally determine ProductItemID \nbecause given a value of Supplier, such as West Coast, you cannot determine a \nsingle value for ProductItemID.\nFinally, note that ProductItemID S Gender, Description, Supplier, Manu-\nfacturer. In other words, because ProductItemID is the key field for this table, it \nfunctionally determines every other column in the rows. Thus, the ProductItem \ntable is normalized correctly. The following sections look at second and third \nnormal forms, including some situations where tables are not normalized com-\npletely and need to be corrected.\n\u275a\n\u275aSecond Normal Form\nA table is in second normal form (2NF) if it is in 1NF and if each non-key \nattribute is functionally dependent on the entire primary key. A table violates \n2NF when a non-key attribute is functionally dependent on only part of the pri-\nmary key, which is only possible if the primary key contains multiple attributes. \nThus, because the ProductItem table is in 1NF, it is also in 2NF because its pri-\nmary key is a single column.\nWhen a table\u2019s primary key consists of two or more attributes, the analyst \nmust examine functional dependency of non-key attributes on each portion \nof the primary key. For example, consider a modified version of the RMO \nPromoOffering table, as shown in Figure 9-16. Recall that this table represents \na many-to-many association between Promotion and ProductItem. Thus, the \ntable representing this association has a primary key consisting of the primary \nkeys of Promotion (PromotionID) and ProductItem (ProductItemID).\nTo be in 2NF, each non-key attribute must be functionally dependent on \nthe entire primary key consisting of the combination of PromotionID and \n\u00ad\nProductItemID. The simplest way to test for 2NF is to test for functional depen-\ndency of non-key attributes on each individual attribute of the primary key. \nBecause\u00a0the primary key contains two attributes, there are two statements that \nFigure 9-15 RMO ProductItem \ntable\nSource: Microsoft Corporation\nsecond normal form (2NF)\u2003 a restriction \nthat a table is in 1NF and that each non-key \nattribute is functionally dependent on the \nentire primary key\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

To test RegularPrice attribute, these \nstatements are:\nRegularPrice is functionally dependent on PromotionID if for each value \nof PromotionID there is only one corresponding value of Regular Price.\nRegularPrice is functionally dependent on ProductItemID if for each value \nof ProductItemID there is only one corresponding value of Regular Price.\nIf either statement is true\u2014that is, an attribute is functionally dependent on \nonly part of the key\u2014then a 2NF violation exists. In this example, the first state-\nment is false, but the second is true. RegularPrice depends on ProductItemID \nregardless of what promotions, if any, a product participates in. Another way \nto think about this example is to think about the underlying association repre-\nsented by the PromoOffering table. A product can be part of multiple promo-\ntions at the same time. Although a product\u2019s promotional price can be different \nin different promotions, its regular price is the same whether it participates in \none promotion, three promotions, or none.\nIf a non-key attribute such as RegularPrice is functionally dependent on \nonly part of the primary key, then you must remove the non-key attribute from \nits present table and place it in another table to satisfy the requirements of \n2NF. Because the first functional dependency statement is true, RegularPrice \nbelongs in a table that has ProductItemID as its primary key. If such a table \ndoesn\u2019t already exist, it must be created. However, in this case, there is \nalready a table with ProductItemID as its primary key: the ProductItem table. \nThus, the column RegularPrice is removed from the PromoOffering table and \nadded to the ProductItem table, thus ensuring that the PromoOffering table \nis in\u00a02NF.\nReferring back to Figure 9-6, notice that the PromoOffering class was \nmodeled incorrectly. It should be clear from our normalization exercise that \nthe RegularPrice attribute really belongs in the ProductItem class and not the \nPromoOffering class. Normalization provides verification that the data model \nwas constructed correctly.\n\u275a\n\u275aThird Normal Form\nA table is in third normal form (3NF) if it is in 2NF and if no non-key attribute \nis functionally dependent on any other non-key attribute. To verify that a table \nis in 3NF, you must check the functional dependency of each non-key attribute \nagainst every other non-key attribute. This can be cumbersome for a large table \nbecause the number of pairs that must be checked grows quickly as the num-\nber of non-key attributes grows. The number of functional dependencies to be \nchecked is N\u00a03\u00a0(N 2 1), where N is the number of non-key attributes. Note, too, \nthat functional dependency must be checked in both directions (i.e., A depen-\ndent on B, and B dependent on A).\nFigure 9-16 Version of the \nRMO PromoOffering table that \nviolates\u00a02NF\nSource: Microsoft Corporation\nthird normal form (3NF)\u2003 a restriction that \na table is in 2NF and that no non-key attribute \nis functionally dependent on any other non-\nkey attribute\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "277\nCHAPTER 9 \u25a0 Designing the Database\nThis section demonstrates two common violations of 3NF. To illustrate \nthese violations, the Sale class and the Customer class in the class diagram have \nbeen modified. Figure 9-17 illustrates these modified classes.\nA common example of a 3NF violation is an attribute that can be computed \nby a formula or algorithm using other table values as inputs. Common examples \nof computable attributes include subtotals, totals, and taxes. To illustrate this \nconcept, the Sale class was modified to include an itemTotal attribute.\nThe modified Sale table is shown in Figure 9-18. The ItemTotal field is the \nsum of SoldPrice amounts from the SaleItem table. The TotalAmt field is the \nsum of the Shipping, Tax, and ItemTotal, as follows:\nTotalAmt 5 Shipping 1 Tax 1 ItemTotal, or  \nFD: Shipping, Tax, ItemTotal S TotalAmt\nComputational dependencies are a form of redundancy because a change to \nthe value of any input variable in the computation (e.g., Shipping) also changes \nthe result of the computation (i.e., TotalAmount). The way to correct this type \nof 3NF violation is simple: Remove the computed attribute from the database. \nEliminating the computed attribute from the database doesn\u2019t mean that its \nvalue is lost. It can always be recalculated when it is needed.\nThe other example in the Customer class is the addition of a creditCategory \nfield along with its associated creditRate (refer back to Figure 9-17). In other \nwords, a creditCategory of A has a creditRate of 6 percent, and a creditCat-\negory of B has a creditRate of 7 percent. It is tempting to put all this data right \nin the Customer table, so that you can see the credit rating of a customer and \nthe interest rate that she must pay. However, it should be obvious that this is a \nbad design. If the interest rate for CreditCategory B changed to 8 percent, there \nmay be hundreds or thousands of places where that value is stored in the Cus-\ntomer table, then requiring an update. The solution to this problem is to make a \nnew table, called CreditRule, with CreditCategory and CreditRate as the fields \nand CreditCategory as the key. The Customer table will have a foreign key that \npoints to the CreditCategory field in the CreditRule table. Figure 9-19 shows \nthe solution with the two tables defined.\nFrom time to time, a database design will relax 3NF requirements and have \nsome tables that are not in 3NF compliance. A common example is a customer \naddress. In the address field, it is normal to have both state and zipcode fields. \nsaleDataTime\npriorityCode\nS&H\ntax\nitemTotal\ntotalAmt\nSale\n1..*\n1\nname\nmobilePhone\nhomePhone\nemailAddress\nstatus\ncreditCategory\ncreditRate\nCustomer\nFigure 9-17 Sale class with \nitemTotal and totalAmt\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nFigure 9-18 Sale table modified to violate 3NF\nSource: Microsoft \nCorporation\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

However, because the zipcode values almost \nnever change, to avoid having a zipcode table, and due to convention, most \ndatabases permit both state fields and zipcode fields in the address information \nof a single table.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Data Types\nA data type defines the storage format and allowable content of a program \nvariable, class attribute, or relational database attribute or column. Primitive \ndata types are supported directly by computer hardware and programming \nlanguages and include integers, single characters, and real numbers (floating-\npoint numbers). Complex data types are combinations of or extensions to \nprimitive data types that are supported by programming languages, operating \nsystems, and DBMSs. Examples include arrays and tables, strings (character \narrays), dates, times, currency (money), audio streams, still images, motion \nvideo streams, and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs or Web links).\nA database designer must choose an appropriate data type for each attri-\nbute in a relational database schema. For many attributes, the choice of a \ndata type is relatively straightforward. For example, designers can represent \ncustomer names and addresses as strings, inventory quantities as integers, and \nitem prices as currency. RDBMSs support a variety of primitive and complex \ndata types required by modern information systems. Figure 9-20 contains a \npartial listing of some of the data types available in the Microsoft SQL Server \nRDBMS.

{"text": "279\nCHAPTER 9 \u25a0 Designing the Database\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Distributed Database Architectures\nEarlier in the chapter, you learned about various database configurations, from \nlocal desktop to LAN server to a large database server farm, and finally to \ndistributed server farms residing in multiple data centers. As an organization \nbecomes very large, with a user base that spans the globe, it becomes more ben-\neficial to locate the data at locations that are closer to the users. There are three \nscenarios for distributing the data:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDecentralized database. In some situations, a global company may \nhave pockets of database users who share data with each other, but do \nnot have the need to share the data globally. Each database may have the \nsame structure and schema as the other databases, but does not need to \nbe connected with Internet or wide area networks (WANs). In this situa-\ntion, the data is purely local, even though the database configuration may \nbe the same.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHomogeneous distributed database. In the situation where the data \nneed to be shared or at least available throughout the reach of the orga-\nnization, a homogeneous distributed database is the correct structure. \n\u00ad\nFigure\u00a09-21 illustrates a typical configuration for this type of environment. \nThe global schema contains the metadata about which data reside at which \nnode and directs queries and updates appropriately. In this configuration, \nthe global schema is available to every database user issuing database que-\nries. Normally, a homogeneous configuration will use the same DBMS at \neach location.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHeterogeneous distributed database. This configuration combines the \nfeatures of the two previous configurations, namely, that there are some \nusers and queries that are purely local, combined with other users and \nqueries that require global access. With a heterogeneous configuration, \ndifferent locations may also utilize distinct DBMSs, especially where most \nof the queries are local and only occasional queries require global inter-\nfaces.

{"text": "280\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Implementation Approaches for Distributed Database\nOnce the need for a distributed database is recognized, decisions must be made \non how to partition the database and what the configuration will be at each \nlocation. Obviously, this is a complex decision that requires careful analysis of \nthe data requirements for each location. Configuration decisions must consider \nsuch things as frequency of queries versus updates; size and frequency of result \nsets; data transmission costs; physical location of server farms; and many other \ncost, efficiency, and performance requirements. The following sections briefly \nconsider four distribution strategies:\n1.\t Data replication\n2.\t Horizontal partitioning\n3.\t Vertical partitioning\n4.\t Combinations of the above three strategies\n\u275a\n\u275aData Replication\nComplete database copies are hosted at each location or server farm and main-\ntained by cooperating DBMSs. The servers are usually distributed across geo-\ngraphic locations. Application programs can access any server and usually make \ndatabase updates to only one server. Servers at distinct locations periodically \nexchange update information to synchronize their database copies.\nApplications can direct access requests to any available server, with prefer-\nence given to the nearest server.

{"text": "281\nCHAPTER 9 \u25a0 Designing the Database\ndatabase servers do have some drawbacks. When data are updated on one data-\nbase copy, clients accessing that same data from another database copy receive \nan outdated response. To counteract this problem, each database copy must \nperiodically be updated with changes from other database servers. This process \nis called database synchronization.\nThe time delay between an update to a database copy and the propaga-\ntion of that update to other database copies is an important database design \ndecision. During the time between the original update and the update of data-\nbase copies, application programs that access outdated copies aren\u2019t receiv-\ning responses that reflect current reality. Designers can address this problem \nby synchronizing more frequently or continuously. However, synchronization \nthen consumes a substantial amount of database server capacity, and a large \namount of network capacity among the related database servers must be pro-\nvided. The proper synchronization strategy is a complex trade-off among cost, \nhardware and network capacity, and the need of application programs and \nusers for current data.\nThe advantage of replicated distributed databases is that each location is \nessentially independent for any given query or update; thus, response times tend \nto be fast. Also, in case of unavailability for any location, the other locations \nare immediately prepared to handle queries. In addition, transaction process-\ning, which requires multiple updates to occur, is straightforward because only \none location is impacted. The two major disadvantages are the increased storage \nrequirements because the database is duplicated multiple times, and, as men-\ntioned previously, keeping all the locations synchronized.\n\u275a\n\u275aHorizontal Partitioning\nHorizontal partitioning of the database occurs when a table is split by storing \nsome rows or records at one location and other rows or records at another loca-\ntion. For example, suppose a large international bank had branches around the \nworld with one data center in the United States, a second data center in Canada, \na third data center in Europe, and so forth. It would make sense to partition the \nCustomerAccount tables, summary, and detail information horizontally so that \nthe data for U.S. customers resided in the U.S. data center. Figure 9-23 illustrates \na global view one of the CustomerAccount tables, showing how it might be par-\ntitioned. The global schema will identify which records reside at which location \nso queries and updates can be routed to the correct data center. For example, a \nperson traveling internationally may need to check her information from various \nlocations around the world. Even though this is a fairly straightforward method \nto partition the database, it does get more complex as customers also become \nglobal and have accounts or loans in multiple locations throughout the world. \nHence, even with horizontal partitioning there may be the need to maintain \nduplicate data or to synchronize data.\nTo reconstruct the complete base tables requires that data from all locations \nbe combined together. This situation might be required for combined reporting \nor data analysis processing.\ndatabase synchronization\u2003 updating one \ndatabase copy with changes made to other \ndatabase copies\nFigure 9-23 Horizontally partitioned table of a database\nSource: Microsoft Corporation\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "282\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nThe major advantage of this configuration is its simplicity. Each data center \nis essentially independent and database access can be optimized as though it \nwere a local data center. Security is also handled at the local level. A disad-\nvantage is that, because there is no duplication, this configuration is subject to \nunavailability should one of the locations experience a catastrophe.\n\u275a\n\u275aVertical Partitioning\nVertical partitioning of the database occurs when complete tables or only specific \ncolumns of a base table are stored at distinct locations. A vertically partitioned \ntable may have some columns at location A, other columns at location B, and \nother columns at location C. Distributing entire base tables to distinct locations \nis fairly straightforward. Distributing only columns of the same table to distinct \nlocations is more complex, and is more complex than horizontal partitioning. So \nwhen would an organization implement vertical partitioning?\nFigure 9-24 illustrates vertical partitions for an AssemblyPart table in a \nSupply Chain database for a company that obtains parts from manufacturers \nin one location, such as Japan, and does final inspection and assembly of those \nparts in another location, such as the United States. For the AssemblyPart table \nin Japan, information is required about the description, the manufacturer, and \nthe quantity on hand of these raw parts. For the AssemblyPart table in the United \nStates, information is required about the description, the schematic number of \nthe assembly instructions, the document number of the inspection instructions, \nand the quantity on hand at the assembly plant. Thus, vertical partitioning of \nthe database occurs more frequently when different functional areas must access \nthe same database and the same data elements.\n\u275a\n\u275aCombination of Replication, Horizontal, and Vertical Partitions\nAll of the preceding three techniques can be combined to provide the right data \nat the right place in the right form. A large international organization will often \nhave different functional areas located at distinct geographical locations, requir-\ning vertical partitioning. Other functional areas, such as Sales, may require cus-\ntomer and sales information at all locations, which may best be partitioned in \na horizontal configuration. Some information, such as corporate-wide informa-\ntion, may need to be available at all locations and may utilize replicated tables. \nThe design and maintenance of this complex configuration would be designed \nunder the direction of the data administrator and the database administrator \nroles, as explained previously. A single project team would not take responsibil-\nity for designing and administering this scenario.\nSource: Microsoft Corporation\nFigure 9-24 Vertical partition of the AssemblyPart table\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Some of this infor-\nmation for RMO was gathered as an analysis activity and is summarized here:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWarehouse staff members (Portland, Salt Lake City, and Albuquerque) need \nto check inventory levels, query orders, record back orders and order fulfill-\nment, and record order returns.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPhone-order staff members (Salt Lake City) need to check inventory levels; \ncreate, query, update, and delete orders; query customer account informa-\ntion; and query catalogs.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCustomers using the online sales system and sales associates in retail stores \nneed the same access capabilities as phone-order staff.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMarketing staff members (Park City) need to query and adjust orders, \nquery and adjust customer accounts, and create and query product and pro-\nmotion information.\nRMO has already decided to manage its database by using the existing \nserver cluster in the Park City data center. That same center will also host serv-\ners supporting the online sales, order fulfillment, and marketing systems. Thus, \na high-capacity wide area network (WAN) will be needed to connect the servers \nto local area networks (LANs) in the warehouses, phone-order centers, retail \nstores, headquarters, and data centers.\nAn architecture that stores the entire database on a single server is not fea-\nsible for the Consolidated Sales and Marketing System. There are many accesses \nfrom many locations at many different times. Inevitable database server down-\ntime would result in lost productivity, sales, and reputation. In essence, the entire \ncompany would grind to a halt, and its future revenue stream would be jeopar-\ndized.

However, as the remote locations \ncontinued to operate, their database contents would gradually drift out of \nsynchronization.\nThe primary disadvantages to the distributed architecture are cost and com-\nplexity. The architecture saves WAN costs through reduced capacity require-\nments, but adds costs for additional database servers. The cost of acquiring, \noperating, and maintaining the additional servers would probably be much \nhigher than the cost of adding greater WAN capacity.\nSo, does the proposed architecture make sense for RMO? The answer \ndepends on some data that hasn\u2019t yet been gathered and on answers to some \nquestions about desired system performance, tolerances for downtime, cost \nand reliability of WAN connections, and the cost and availability of cloud \nservices. RMO management must also determine its goals for system perfor-\nmance and\u00a0reliability. The distributed architecture would provide higher per-\nformance\u00a0and reliability but at substantially increased cost. Management must \ndetermine whether the extra cost is worth the expected benefits.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Protecting the Database\nIn Chapter 6, you learned about the need to consider security issues early in the \ndevelopment of the new system. In the discussion of access controls in \u00ad\nChapter\u00a06, \nyou learned about the process of authentication and authorization. Those con-\ncepts apply directly to the protection of the data in the database and are used \nextensively before allowing access to the database. Additional techniques, such \nas data encryption, are also a frequently used technique to keep the data pro-\ntected from unauthorized persons and programs.\nThe responsibility for designing and deploying a secure database is shared \nbetween the project team, that is, the system development team, and the DBA. \nThe DBA provides advice and direction to the project team as they design the \nnew system to ensure that proper controls and mechanisms are included in \nthe\u00a0code of the new system. The DBA then has responsibility for protecting the \nDBMS and the database when it is put into production and while it is opera-\ntional. In Figure 9-1, you see that there are three types of agents that have access \nto the database: the application programs, database users, and database admin-\nistrators. The development team plays a major role in the security aspects of the \napplication programs. The DBA is concerned about security for all three types \nof agents.\nIn today\u2019s computing environment where databases are available to the \nentire world via the Internet, you will frequently read about occasions when a \nparticular database has been compromised and private data has been exposed. \nProtecting the database is a serious issue in the development and deployment of \ninformation systems, and a thorough treatment of the subject is well beyond the \nscope of this textbook. There are many books and even university courses that \ncover security for information systems, networks, and databases.\nIn addition to the security issues for protecting the database, there is the \nneed to protect the data in the database from catastrophes ranging from sim-\nple power outages to major natural disasters. The following sections provide \nan introduction to some of the concepts, including programming issues, related \nto transaction logging and complex updates.

{"text": "285\nCHAPTER 9 \u25a0 Designing the Database\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Transaction Logging\nTransaction logging is a technique by which any update to the database is \nlogged with such audit information as user ID, date, time, input data, and type \nof update. Transaction logging provides a record of database changes that is \nstored in a separate location and can be checked independently of the database \nitself. The fundamental idea is to create an audit trail of all database updates \nand, therefore, track any errors or problems that occur. Most DBMSs include \ntransaction logging as part of the DBMS software, although database designers \nor administrators can customize its application.\nTransaction logging achieves two objectives. First, it helps discourage \nfraudulent transactions or malicious database changes. For example, if a person \nknows that his or her ID will be associated with every check request, that person \nisn\u2019t likely to request a bogus payment. Similarly, a disgruntled employee who \nmight be tempted to delete important records knows that his or her actions are \nbeing logged.\nSecond, a logging system provides a recovery mechanism for erroneous \ntransactions. A midlevel logging system maintains the set of all updates. The \nsystem can then recover from errors by \u201cunapplying\u201d the erroneous transac-\ntions. More sophisticated logging systems can provide \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d \nimages of the attributes or rows that are changed by the transaction as well as \nthe audit trail of all transactions. These sophisticated systems are typically used \nonly for highly sensitive or critical data files, but they do represent an important \ncontrol mechanism that is available when necessary.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Concurrency and Complex Update Controls\nDatabases provide the foundation of almost every activity that is performed \nusing an electronic device. Activities such as making a call on a cell phone, shop-\nping online, sending a text, playing an Internet game, sharing your photos online, \naccessing your Facebook account, checking the price of your stocks and bonds all \ndepend on databases and database technology. As you can imagine, large, active \ndatabases often have tens of thousands of users every minute who need to read \nand update the data. Not only do databases need to be extremely fast, but they \nalso need to be designed so that multiple users do not damage each other\u2019s data \ninadvertently when they are accessing or updating the same information.\nIn some situations, such as looking at your online photos, users will be \naccessing personal or private information that only they will be using. How-\never, in many situations, such as online shopping, the same information can \nbe desired by thousands of users at the same time\u2014some of which will only \nlook at it, but others will need to update it. For example, when you purchase \nsomething on Amazon, the inventory levels and availability information must be \nupdated immediately. It is not uncommon for multiple customers to be viewing \nand updating the information at the same time.\nOne of the problems that potentially can occur when multiple people are \nupdating the database at the same time is called the \u201clost update problem.\u201d For \nexample, suppose Bill wants to buy some shoes. He accesses the record that con-\ntains shoe inventory levels. It indicates that there are 10 pairs in stock. Gary also \nwants to buy the same shoes, and also reads the shoe information. Bill buys a \npair of shoes, and the system decrements the quantity and rewrites the quantity \nto nine pairs left. Gary does the same, and the system also rewrites the quantity \nto nine\u00a0pairs. Unfortunately, Bill\u2019s update was overwritten by Gary\u2019s and so it \nbecomes a \u201clost update.\u201d\nTo solve this problem, techniques that implement two concepts are used. \nThis section introduces the concepts, but does not explain all the techniques. \nThe details of the techniques are beyond the scope of this text and fit more com-\nfortably in a database textbook.\ntransaction logging\u2003 a technique by which \nany update to the database is logged with \nsuch audit information as user ID, date, time, \ninput data, and type of update\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "286\nPART 3 \u25a0 Essentials of Systems Design\nThe first concept is of a transaction. A transaction is a piece of work that \nhas several steps, including several reads and writes to the database, that must \nall be completed to be valid. An example might be buying movie tickets online. \nThe transaction will require the following steps:\n1.\t Read the database for available seats and display it.\n2.\t Update the database when the user chooses seats.\n3.\t Start a timer.\n4.\t Accept user purchase information (credit card number).\n5.\t Verify credit and send a charge to the user\u2019s credit card.\n6.\t Post the user\u2019s payment to the company ledger.\n7.\t Permanently update the seat database that the chosen seats are now taken.\n8.\t Update the user information with a reservation for the specific seats.\nAll of these steps must be completed for the \u201cpurchase ticket transaction\u201d to \nbe complete. If the user stops, if the credit card charge is refused, or if the timer \nruns out, then all the prior changes must be undone, and the database returned \nto its original condition. This is a rather long transaction involving a consider-\nable period of time and many steps.\nThe second important concept that is widely used to protect against lost \nupdates is to apply a database lock. A database lock is the technique where a por-\ntion of the database is locked by one user so that no other users (or programs) can \nuse that portion of the database until the first user is finished and releases the lock.\nThe portion of the database that is locked can vary and is usually a design \nissue decided by the DBA. Locks can be applied to individual columns, to single \nrecords or table rows, to an entire table, or even to the entire database. Locking \nsmall portions of the database, such as a column or even a row, requires more \nsophistication to track it and control it. However, it is more efficient because \nother users can still use most of the database. Locking large portions, such as an \nentire table or even the database, is easy to implement, but makes the database \ninefficient for a multiple-user environment. The DBA decides the best type of \nlocking to use depending on the use and activity level of the database.\nThere are two types of locks that are used, a shared lock, also called a read \nlock, and an exclusive lock, also called a write lock. If the user application only \nneeds to read the data, with no need to update it, it can issue a shared lock. A \nshared lock allows other users to also read the same data, but not to update it. \nIf the user application needs to read and then rewrite the data, then an exclusive \nlock is issued. No other user can even read the data that has an exclusive lock.\ntransaction\u2003 a piece of work with several \nsteps that must all be completed to be valid\ndatabase lock\u2003 the technique of applying \nexclusive control to a part of the database so \nthat one user at a time can use the data\nshared or read lock\u2003 a lock where other \ntransactions are allowed to read the\u00a0data\nexclusive or write lock\u2003 a lock where no \nother activity is allowed, neither reading nor \nwriting the data\nChapter Summary\nMost modern information systems store data in a \ndatabase and access and manage the data by using \na\u00a0DBMS. The actual design of the database schema is \na responsibility of the project team, with input from \nother technical staff, such as the DA and the DBA. \nOne of the key activities of systems design is develop-\ning a relational database schema. A relational database \nis a collection of data stored in tables. A relational \ndatabase schema is normally developed from a domain \nclass diagram. Each class is represented as a separate \ntable. One-to-many associations are represented by \nembedding foreign keys in class tables. Many-to-many \nassociations are represented by creating additional \ntables containing foreign keys of the related classes.\nAs organizations grow and become global, there \nis frequently a need to distribute the database across \nmultiple data centers in distinct physical locations. \nMethods of partitioning the database, either horizon-\ntally or vertically, are used to provide an effective, yet \nreliable distribution of data between the data centers.\nBecause stored data is such an important organi-\nzational asset, database design incorporates security \nmeasures to ensure the correctness, completeness, and \nsecurity of data.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Project manag-\ners rely on a variety of aids to help them with every step of the process. So far \nin this text, you have learned about analysis and design models and techniques, \nand now you will learn more about the overall system development process. You \nlearned about the system development life cycle (SDLC) in Chapter 1. That par-\nticular SDLC included six core processes and multiple iterations. This chapter \ndiscusses the SDLC in more detail, including some variations found in industry.\nThe entire process of developing an information system requires more \nthan just an SDLC. A system development methodology includes more specific \ninstructions for completing the activities of each core process by using specific \nmodels, tools, and techniques. As mentioned in Chapter 1, a system develop-\nment methodology is sometimes referred to as a development process.\nAlso as mentioned in Chapter 1, most newer system development method-\nologies are Agile. Agile development is further discussed in this chapter as a phi-\nlosophy that guides a development project. Aside from being iterative, it focuses \nOpening case\u2002 \u0007\nKim, Mary, and Bob, graduating seniors, were discussing \ntheir recent interview visits to companies that recruit com-\nputer information system (CIS) majors on their campus. All \nagreed that they had learned a lot by visiting the compa-\nnies, but they also all felt somewhat overwhelmed.\n\u201cAt first, I wasn\u2019t sure I knew what they were talking \nabout,\u201d Kim said. During her on-campus interview, she had \nimpressed Ajax Corporation with her knowledge of data \nmodeling and database management. And when she vis-\nited the company\u2019s home office data center for her second \ninterview, the interviewers spent a lot of time describing \nthe company\u2019s system development methodology.\n\u201cThey said to forget everything I learned in school,\u201d \nKim continued. \u201cThat got my attention.\u201d\nAjax Corporation had purchased a complete devel-\nopment methodology called IM One from a small con-\nsulting firm. Most of its employees agreed that it worked \nfairly well, having invested a lot of time and money learn-\ning and adapting to it. Those who had worked for Ajax \nfor a long time thought IM One was unique, and they \nwere very proud of it.\n\u201cThen, they started telling me about their iterative \nSDLC, business events, use cases, and domain model \nclass diagrams\u2014things like that,\u201d Kim said. She had rec-\nognized that many of the key concepts in the IM One \nmethodology were fairly standard models and tech-\nniques from UML and iterative development concepts \nthat she had learned in school.\n\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d said Mary, a very talented \nprogrammer who knew just about every popular program-\nming language available. \u201cConsolidated Concepts went \non and on about things like OMG, UP, and people named \nBooch, Rumbaugh, and Jacobson. It turns out they use \nthe object-oriented approach to develop their systems, \nand they like the fact that I know Java and C# and .NET. \nThere was no problem once I got past all the people\u2019s \nnames and acronyms they used. The actual models and \ntechniques they used were very familiar to\u00a0me.\u201d\nBob, who interviewed with Pinnacle Manufacturing, \nhad a different story to tell. \u201cA few people said analy-\nsis and design are no longer a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd \nI\u2019m thinking, \u2018Knowing that would have saved me some \ntime in school.\u2019\u201d\nPinnacle has a small system development group \nsupporting its manufacturing and inventory control. \n\u201cThey said they like to jump in and get to the code as \nsoon as possible,\u201d Bob said. \u201cLittle documentation and \nnot much of a project plan. They showed me some \nbooks on their desks, and it looked like they had been \ndoing a lot of reading about analysis and design. I could \nsee they were using Agile development and Agile mod-\neling techniques and focusing on best practices required \nfor their small projects. It turns out they just organize \ntheir work differently by looking at risk and writing user \nstories while building prototypes. I recognized some \nsketches of class diagrams and sequence diagrams on \nthe boss\u2019s whiteboard, so I felt fairly comfortable that \nthey were using an Agile approach like XP or Scrum but \nstill doing some modeling after all.\u201d\nKim, Mary, and Bob agreed that there was much \nto learn in these work environments but also that there \nare many different ways to describe the key concepts \nand techniques they learned in school. They were all \nglad they focused on the fundamentals in their CIS \nclasses and that they had been exposed to a variety of \napproaches to system development.\nDevelopment Approaches at Ajax Corporation, \nConsolidated Concepts, and Pinnacle Manufacturing\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Finally, some specific \nAgile system development methodologies are described, including Agile Unified \n\u00ad\nProcess, Extreme Programming, and Scrum.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The System Development Life Cycle\nChapter 1 demonstrated how analysis and design models and techniques are \nused to solve business problems by building an information system. For prob-\nlem-solving work to be productive, it needs to be organized and goal-oriented. \nAnalysts achieve these results by organizing the work into projects. As defined \nin Chapter 1, a project is a planned undertaking, with a beginning and end that \nproduces a well-defined result or product. The term information system devel-\nopment project refers to a planned undertaking that produces a new information \nsystem. Some system development projects are very large, requiring thousands \nof hours of work by many people and spanning several calendar years. In the \nRMO case study introduced in Chapter 2, the system being developed is a mod-\nerately sized computer-based information system requiring a moderately sized \nproject. Many system development projects are smaller, lasting a few months. \nSome are very small, such as the Tradeshow application in Chapter 1.\nFor a system development project to be successful, it must be planned and \norganized. The plan must include a comprehensive set of activities that flow in \nthe proper sequence. Otherwise, activities are omitted or work may need to be \ndone multiple times. The end result, of course, is producing a high-quality infor-\nmation system as measured by its reliability, robustness, efficiency, and fitness \nfor purpose. The system development life cycle (SDLC), which was introduced in \nChapter 1, is a fundamental concept in the success of information system devel-\nopment projects.\nThe SDLC provides a way to think about the development of a new system \nas a progressive process, much like a living entity. This concept can be expanded \nand you can view the information system as having a life itself; in fact, we often \nrefer to the life cycle of a system. During its life cycle, an information system is \nfirst conceived, then it is designed, built, and deployed as part of a development \nproject, and, finally, it is put into production and used to support the business. \nHowever, even during its productive use, a system is still a dynamic, living entity \nthat is updated, modified, and repaired through smaller projects.\nSeveral projects may be required during the life of a system, first to develop \nthe original system and then to upgrade. This text focuses on the initial develop-\nment project, not on the support projects. In other words, the primary concern \nis with getting the new system developed and deployed.\nIn today\u2019s diverse development environment, there are many approaches to \ndeveloping systems, and they are based on different approaches to the SDLC. \nAlthough it is difficult to find a single, comprehensive classification system that \nencompasses all the approaches, one useful way to categorize them is along a \ncontinuum from predictive to adaptive (see Figure 10-1).\nThe choice of SDLC varies depending on the project\nPredictive\nSDLC\nAdaptive\nSDLC\nRequirements well understood\nand well defined.\nLow technical risk.\nRequirements and needs\nuncertain.\nHigh technical risk.\nFigure 10-1 Predictive versus \nadaptive approaches to the SDLC\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "298\nPART 4 \u25a0 System Development and Project Management\nA predictive approach to the SDLC assumes that the development proj-\nect can be planned and organized and that the new information system can \nbe developed according to the plan. Predictive SDLCs are useful for building \nsystems that are well understood and defined. For example, a company may \nwant to convert its old networked client/server system to a newer Web-based \nsystem that includes a smartphone app. In this type of project, the staff already \nunderstands the requirements very well, and no new processes need to be added. \nThus, the project can be carefully planned, and the system can be built accord-\ning to the specifications.\nAn adaptive approach to the SDLC is used when the system\u2019s requirements \nand/or the users\u2019 needs aren\u2019t well understood. In this situation, the project can\u2019t \nbe planned completely. Some system requirements may need to be determined \nafter preliminary development work. Developers should still be able to build the \nsolution, but they need to be flexible and adapt the project as it progresses. Recall \nthat the Tradeshow System described in Chapter 1 used this approach.\nIn practice, any project could have\u2014and most do have\u2014predictive and \nadaptive elements. That is why Figure 10-1 shows them as endpoints along a \ncontinuum, not as mutually exclusive categories. The predictive approaches are \nmore traditional and were conceived during the 1970s through the 1990s. Many \nof the newer, adaptive approaches have evolved with object-oriented technol-\nogy and Web development; they were created during the late 1990s and into \nthe twenty-first century. The following sections look at the more predictive \napproaches and then examine the newer adaptive approaches.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Traditional Predictive Approaches to the SDLC\nThe development of a new information system requires a number of different but \nrelated sets of activities. In predictive approaches, there is a group of activities that \nidentifies the problem and secures approval to develop a new system; this is called \nproject initiation. A second group of activities, called project planning, involves \nplanning, organizing, and scheduling the project. These activities map out the proj-\nect\u2019s overall structure. A third group\u2014analysis\u2014focuses on discovering and under-\nstanding the details of the problem or need. The intent here is to figure out exactly \nwhat the system must do to support the business processes. A\u00a0fourth group\u2014\ndesign\u2014focuses on configuring and structuring the new \u00ad\nsystem components. These \nactivities use the requirements that were defined earlier to develop the program \nstructure and the algorithms for the new system. A fifth group\u2014implementation\u2014 \nincludes \u00ad\nprogramming and testing the system. A sixth group\u2014deployment\u2014 \ninvolves installing and putting the system into operation.\nThese six groups of activities\u2014project initiation, project planning, analysis, \ndesign, implementation, and deployment\u2014are sometimes referred to as phases \nof the system development project, and they provide the framework for manag-\ning the project. Another phase, called the support phase, includes the activi-\nties needed to upgrade and maintain the system after it has been deployed. The \nsupport phase is part of the overall SDLC, but it isn\u2019t normally considered part \nof the initial development project. Figure 10-2 illustrates the six phases of a \npredictive approach to the SDLC\u2003 an \napproach that assumes the project can \nbe planned in advance and that the new \n\u00ad\ninformation system can be developed \n\u00ad\naccording to the plan\nadaptive approach to the SDLC\u2003 an \napproach that assumes the project must be \nmore flexible and adapt to changing needs as \nthe project progresses\nphases\u2003 related groups of development \nactivities, such as initiation, planning, \nanalysis, design, implementation, deployment, \nand support\nProject\nplanning\nAnalysis\nDesign\nImplementation\nProject\ninitiation\nSupport\nDeployment\nFigure 10-2 Traditional information system development phases (with support phase)\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "299\nCHAPTER 10 \u25a0 Approaches to System Development\ntraditional predictive SDLC plus the support phase. Note that the main differ-\nence from the iterative SDLC used in this text is that the activities are carried \nout sequentially rather than repeated in each iteration.\nThe most predictive SDLC approach (i.e., farthest to the left on the predictive/\nadaptive scale) is called a waterfall model, with the phases of the project flowing \ndown, one after another. As shown in Figure 10-3, this model assumes that the \nphases can be carried out and completed sequentially. First, a detailed plan is devel-\noped, then the requirements are thoroughly specified, then the system is designed \ndown to the last algorithm, and then it is programmed, tested, and installed. After \na project drops over the waterfall into the next phase, there is no going back. In \npractice, the waterfall model assumes rigid planning and final decision making \nat each step of the development project. As you may have guessed, the waterfall \nmodel doesn\u2019t always work very well. Being human, developers are rarely able to \ncomplete a phase without making mistakes or leaving out important components \nthat have to be added later. However, even though the waterfall model isn\u2019t used in \nits purest form anymore, it still provides a valuable foundation for understanding \ndevelopment. No matter what system is being developed, you need to include initia-\ntion, planning, analysis, design, implementation, and deployment activities.\nA little farther to the right on the predictive/adaptive scale are modified \nwaterfall models. These are still predictive\u2014that is, they still assume a fairly \nthorough plan\u2014but there is a recognition that the project\u2019s phases must overlap, \ninfluencing and depending on each other. Some analysis must be done before \nthe designing can start, but during the design, there is a need for more detail in \nthe requirements or perhaps it is discovered that a requirement cannot be met \nin the manner originally requested. Figure 10-4 illustrates how these activities \ncan\u00a0overlap.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Newer Adaptive Approaches to the SDLC\nIn an adaptive approach, project activities\u2014including plans and models\u2014are \nadjusted as the project progresses. There are many ways to depict an adaptive \nSDLC. All include iterations, which were discussed in Chapter 1. Rather than \nhaving the analysis, design, and implementation phases proceed sequentially \nwith some overlap, iterations can be used to create a series of mini-projects that \naddress smaller parts of the application. One of these smaller parts is analyzed, \ndesigned, built, and tested during a single iteration; then, based on the results, the \nnext iteration proceeds to analyze, design, build, and test the\u00a0next\u00a0smaller\u00a0part. \nwaterfall model\u2003 an SDLC approach \nthat assumes the phases can be completed \nsequentially with no overlap\nFigure 10-3 Waterfall model of the SDLC\nProject\ninitiation\nDeployment\nImplementation\nDesign\nAnalysis\nInitiation and\nplanning\nspecifications frozen\nAnalysis\nspecifications\nfrozen\nSystem built and\ndelivered exactly\nas specified\nDesign\nspecifications\nfrozen\nProject\nplanning\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "300\nPART 4 \u25a0 System Development and Project Management\nUsing iterations, the project is able to adapt to any changes as it proceeds. Also, \nparts of the system are available early on for user evaluation and feedback, \nwhich helps ensure that the application will meet the needs of the users.\nYou first saw this concept in the SDLC example used in Chapter 1, which \nis repeated here as Figure 10-5. The core processes defined in Chapter 1 are \ncarried out in each iteration of the project. This iterative approach is adaptive \nbecause with each iteration\u2019s analysis, design, and implementation, modifica-\ntions can be made to adapt to the changing requirements of the project. The \nadaptive approach presented in this textbook is a simplification of and variation \non a more formal iterative approach called the Unified Process (UP). You will \nlearn more about the UP later in this chapter.\nA related concept to an iterative SDLC is called incremental \u00ad\ndevelopment. \nIncremental development is always based on an iterative life cycle. The basic \nidea is that the system is built in small increments. An increment may be devel-\noped within a single iteration or it may require two or three iterations. As each \nincrement is completed, it is integrated with the whole. The system, in effect, is \n\u201cgrown\u201d in an organic fashion. The advantage of this approach is that portions \nof the system get into the users\u2019 hands much sooner so the business can begin \naccruing benefits as early as possible.\nYet another related concept, which is also based on an iterative approach, is \nthe idea of a walking skeleton.

Later iterations then flesh out the skeleton with \nmore functions and capabilities. It should be obvious that this approach also \ngets working software into the hands of the users early in the project. Both these \napproaches have the additional advantage of extensive user testing and feedback \nto the project team as the project is progressing\u2014another example of how an \niterative project is also adaptive.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Methodologies, Models, Tools, and Techniques\nAside from an SDLC, systems developers have a variety of aids at their disposal \nto help them complete activities and tasks. Among them are methodologies, \nmodels, tools, and techniques. The following sections discuss each of these aids.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Methodologies\nA system development methodology as described in Chapter 1 provides guide-\nlines for every facet of the system development life cycle. For example, within a \nmethodology, certain models, such as diagrams, are used to describe and specify \nthe requirements. Related to these models are the techniques for how the project \nteam will do its work. An example of a technique is the guidelines for conducting \na user interview that you learned about in Chapter 2. Finally, each project team \nwill use a set of tools\u2014usually computer-based tools\u2014to build models, record \ninformation, and write the code. These tools are considered part of the overall \nmethodology used for a given project. Figure 10-6 illustrates that the techniques, \nmodels, and tools support one another to provide a comprehensive, integrated \nmethodology. Some methodologies are developed by systems professionals within \nthe company based on their experience. Others are learned and used based on \npurchased materials and training from consulting firms or\u00a0vendors.\nSome methodologies (whether created in-house or purchased) contain mas-\nsive written documentation that defines everything the developers may need \nto produce at any point in the project, including how the documentation itself \nshould look and what reports to management should contain. Other methodolo-\ngies are much more informal, such as a single document that contains general \ndescriptions of what needs to be done. Sometimes, the methodology a company \nadopts isn\u2019t only informal, it is ad hoc and almost undefined, but such free-\ndom of choice is becoming rare. Management in most IT departments prefers to \nadopt a flexible methodology so it can be adapted to different types of projects \nand systems.

{"text": "302\nPART 4 \u25a0 System Development and Project Management\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Models\nAnytime people need to record or communicate information, it is useful to \ncreate a model. As discussed in Chapter 2, a model is a representation of an \nimportant aspect of the real world. Sometimes, the term abstraction is used \nbecause people abstract (separate out) an aspect that is of particular impor-\ntance to them. For example, consider an airplane model. To talk about the \naerodynamics of the airplane, it is useful to have a model that shows the plane\u2019s \noverall shape in three dimensions. Sometimes, a drawing of the cross-sectional \ndetails of the plane\u2019s wing is what is needed. In other cases, a mathematical \nformulation of the plane\u2019s aerodynamic characteristics might be necessary to \nunderstand how it will behave.\nSome models are physically similar to the real product. Some are graphi-\ncal representations of important details. And some are abstract mathematical \nnotations. Each emphasizes a particular type of information. In airplane design, \nengineers use lots of different models. Learning to be an aerospace engineer \ninvolves learning how to create and use all the various models. That is true for \nan information system developer too, although the models for information sys-\ntems aren\u2019t as standardized or precise as aerospace models. System developers \nare making progress, but the field is very young, and many senior analysts were \nself-taught. More important, an information system is much less tangible than \nan airplane; you can\u2019t really see, hold, or touch it. Therefore, the models of the \ninformation system can seem much less tangible too.\nThe models used in system development include representations of inputs, \noutputs, processes, data, objects, object interactions, locations, networks, and \ndevices, among other things. Most of the models are graphical models, which \nare drawn representations that employ agreed-upon symbols and conventions. \nThese are often called diagrams and charts, and the UML diagrams you have \nencountered so far in this book are examples. Much of this text describes how \nto read and create a variety of models that represent an information system.\nAnother important kind of model is a project-planning model, such \nas a Gantt chart or net present value (NPV), both of which are discussed in \n\u00ad\nChapter\u00a011. These models represent the system development project itself, \nhighlighting its tasks and other considerations. Yet another model related to \nproject management is a chart showing all the people assigned to the project. \n\u00ad\nFigure\u00a010-7 lists some models used in system development.\nSome models of system components\n \nUse case diagram\n \nDomain model class diagram\n \nDesign class diagram\n \nSequence diagram\n \nPackage diagram\n \nScreen design template\n \nDialog design storyboard\n \nEntity-relationship diagram (ERD) \n \nDatabase schema\nSome models used to manage the development process\n \nGantt chart\n \nOrganizational hierarchy chart\n \nFinancial analysis models\u2014NPV, payback period\n \nSystem development life-cycle model\n \nStakeholders list\n \nIteration plan\nFigure 10-7 Some models used \nin system development\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Tools might be \nsimple drawing programs for creating diagrams. They might also include an \napplication that stores information about the project, such as data definitions, \nuse case descriptions, and other artifacts. A project management software \ntool, such as Microsoft Project, is another example of a tool used to create \nmodels. The project management tool creates a model of the project tasks and \ntask dependencies.\nTools have been specifically designed to help system developers. Program-\nmers should be familiar with integrated development environments \n(IDEs), which include many tools to help with programming tasks\u2014for exam-\nple, smart editors, context-sensitive help, and debugging tools. Some tools can \ngenerate program code for the developer. Some tools reverse engineer old pro-\ngrams, generating a model from the code so the developer can determine what \nthe program does if its documentation is missing (or was never done). Visual \nmodeling tools are available to systems analysts to help them create and ver-\nify important system models. These tools are used to draw such diagrams as \nclass diagrams or activity diagrams. Other visual modeling tools help design \nthe database or even generate program code. Figure 10-8 lists the types of \ntools used in system development.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Techniques\nYou learned several techniques for gathering information in Chapter 2. You \nlearned many techniques for defining functional requirements in Chapters 3, \n4, and 5, and many design techniques in Chapters 6, 7, 8, and 9. In system \n\u00ad\ndevelopment, a technique is a collection of guidelines that helps an analyst \ncomplete an activity or task. It often includes step-by-step instructions for cre-\nating a model, or it might include more general advice on collecting information \nfrom system users. Examples include data-modeling techniques, software-\u00ad\ntesting techniques, user-interviewing techniques, and relational database \n \ndesign techniques.\nSometimes, a technique applies to an entire life cycle phase and helps you \ncreate several models and other documents. The modern structured analysis \ntechnique (discussed later) is an example of this. Figure 10-9 lists some tech-\nniques commonly used in system development.\nHow do methodologies, models, tools, and techniques fit together? A meth-\nodology includes a collection of techniques that are used to complete activities \nwithin each phase or iteration of the system development life cycle.

{"text": "304\nPART 4 \u25a0 System Development and Project Management\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Agile Development\nThe highly volatile marketplace has forced businesses to respond rapidly to new \nopportunities. Sometimes, these opportunities appear in the middle of imple-\nmenting another business initiative. To survive, businesses must be agile\u2014\nthat is, able to change directions rapidly, even in the middle of a \u00ad\nproject. \nAgile\u00a0\u00ad\ndevelopment is a philosophy and set of guidelines for developing infor-\nmation systems in an unknown, rapidly changing environment, and it can be \nused with any system development methodology. Usually, Agile development \ncomplements adaptive approaches to the SDLC and methodologies that support \nit. But the emphasis is on taking an adaptive approach and making it agile in all \ndevelopment activities and tasks. Related to Agile development, Agile model-\ning is a philosophy about how to build models, some of which are formal and \ndetailed, others sketchy and minimal. All the models you have learned how to \ncreate in this text can be used with Agile modeling.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Agile Development Philosophy and Values\nThe \u201cManifesto for Agile Software Development\u201d (see the \u201cFurther Resources\u201d \nsection) identifies four basic values, which represent the core philosophy of \nAgile\u00a0development:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nValue responding to change over following a plan\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nValue individuals and interactions over processes and tools\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nValue working software over comprehensive documentation\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nValue customer collaboration over contract negotiation\nThe people involved in system development\u2014whether as team members, \nusers, or other stakeholders\u2014all need to accept these priorities for a project to \nbe truly agile. Adopting an Agile approach isn\u2019t always easy. Managers and exec-\nutive stakeholders frequently have trouble accepting this less-rigid viewpoint, \nwanting instead to impose more controls on development teams and enforce \ndetailed plans and schedules. However, the Agile philosophy takes the opposite \napproach, providing more flexibility in project schedules and letting the project \nteams plan and execute their work as the project progresses.\nSome industry leaders in the Agile movement coined the term chaordic to \ndescribe an Agile project. Chaordic comes from two words: chaos and order. \nThe first two values in the list do seem to be a recipe for chaos, but software \nprojects always have unpredictable elements\u2014hence, a certain amount of \nchaos. The Agile philosophy recognizes this unpredictability, handling it with \nincreased flexibility and by trusting the project team to develop solutions to \nproject problems.

Developers need \nto accept a certain amount of chaos and mix that with other Agile modeling and \ndevelopment techniques that help to provide order and structure to the project. \n\u00ad\nChapter\u00a011 will cover many of these Agile project management techniques.\nAnother important aspect of Agile development is that customers must \ncontinually be involved with the project team. They don\u2019t just sit down with \nthe project team for a few sessions to develop the specifications and then go \ntheir separate ways. They become part of the technical team. Because work-\ning\u00a0software is being developed throughout the project, customers are continu-\nally involved in defining requirements and testing components.\nHistorically, particularly with predictive projects, many system development \nefforts attempted to be fixed-price endeavors. This was true for both in-house \ngroups and external development teams. However, the approach with Agile devel-\nopment is that system development projects should be more of a collaborative effort. \nHence, contracts take on an entirely different flavor. Fixed prices and fixed deliver-\nables don\u2019t make sense. Contracts for Agile projects include other kinds of options \nfor the customer. The approach to the scheduling of activities, the delivery of system \ncomponents, and the early termination of the project allow the client to maintain \ncontrol, but it is done with different options than with fixed-bid contracts.\nModels and modeling are critical to Agile development, so the next section \nlooks at Agile modeling. Many of the core values are illustrated in the principles \nand practices of building models.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Agile Modeling Principles\nMuch of this text teaches techniques for creating models. Your first impression \nmight be that an Agile approach means less modeling or maybe even no \u00ad\nmodeling. \nAgile modeling (AM) isn\u2019t about doing less modeling, but about doing the right \nkind of modeling at the right level of detail for the right purposes. AM doesn\u2019t \ndictate which models to build or how formal to make those models. Instead, it \nhelps developers stay on track with their models by using them as a means to an \nend rather than end deliverables. AM\u2019s basic principles express the attitude that \ndevelopers should have as they develop software. Figure 10-10 summarizes Agile \nmodeling principles. Those principles are discussed next.\nAgile modeling (AM)\u2003 a guiding philosophy \nin which only models that are necessary, with \na valid need and at the right level of detail, \nare created\nMinimize modeling\nHigh-quality models,\nget feedback\nAdapt to specific project\nneeds\nSoftware is your\nprimary goal\nModel with a purpose\nEmbrace change,\nchange incrementally\nNext effort is your\nsecondary goal\nBuild multiple models\nKnow your models and\nhow to use them\nCommunicate and learn\nfrom each other\nFocus on content,\nnot representation\nMaximize stakeholder\nROI\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nFigure 10-10 Agile modeling principles\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "306\nPART 4 \u25a0 System Development and Project Management\n\u275a\n\u275aDevelop Software as Your Primary Goal\nThe primary goal of a software development project is to produce high-quality \n\u00ad\nsoftware. The primary measurement of progress is working software, not intermedi-\nate models of system requirements or specifications. Modeling is always a means to \nan end, not the end itself. Any activity that doesn\u2019t directly contribute to the end goal \nof producing software should be questioned and avoided if it cannot be justified.\n\u275a\n\u275aEnable the Next Effort as Your Secondary Goal\nFocusing only on working software can also be self-defeating, so developers \nmust consider two important objectives. First, requirements models might be \nnecessary to develop design models. So, don\u2019t think that if the model cannot \nbe used to write code, it is unnecessary. Sometimes, several intermediate steps \nare needed before the final code can be written. Second, although high-\u00ad\nquality \n\u00ad\nsoftware is the primary goal, long-term use of that code is also important. \n \nSo, some models might be necessary to support maintenance and enhancement of \nthe system. Yes, the code is the best documentation, but some architectural design \ndecisions might not be easily identified from the code. Look carefully at what other \nartifacts might be necessary to produce high-quality systems in the long term.\n\u275a\n\u275aMinimize Your Modeling Activity\u2014Few and Simple\nCreate only the models that are necessary. Do just enough to get by. This prin-\nciple isn\u2019t a justification for sloppy work or inadequate analysis. The models you \ncreate should be clear, correct, and complete. But don\u2019t create unnecessary mod-\nels. Also, keep each model as simple as possible. Normally, the simplest solution \nis the best solution. Elaborate solutions tend to be difficult to understand and \nmaintain. However, simplicity isn\u2019t a justification for being incomplete.\n\u275a\n\u275aEmbrace Change and Change Incrementally\nBecause the underlying philosophy of Agile modeling is that developers must \nbe flexible and respond quickly to change, a good Agile developer willingly \naccepts\u2014even embraces\u2014change. Change is seen as the norm, not the excep-\ntion. Watch for change, and have procedures ready to integrate changes into the \nmodels. The best way to accept change is to develop incrementally. Take small \nsteps and address problems in small bites. Change your model incrementally and \nthen validate it to make sure it is correct. Don\u2019t try to accomplish everything in \none big release.\n\u275a\n\u275aModel with a Purpose\nRecall that the two reasons to build models are to understand what you are \nbuilding and to communicate important aspects of the solution system. Make \nsure your modeling efforts support those reasons. Sometimes, developers try to \njustify building models by claiming that (1) the development methodology man-\ndates the development of the model, (2) someone wants a model, even though \nthe person doesn\u2019t know why it is important, or (3) a model can replace a face-\nto-face discussion of issues. Identify a reason and an audience for each model \nyou develop. Then, develop the model in sufficient detail to satisfy the reason \nand the audience. Incidentally, the audience might be you.\n\u275a\n\u275aBuild Multiple Models\nAlong with other modeling methodologies, UML has several models to represent \ndifferent aspects of the problem at hand. To be successful\u2014in understanding the \nproblem or communicating the solution\u2014you need to model the critical aspects \nof the problem domain or the required solution. Don\u2019t develop all of them; be \nsure to minimize your modeling, but develop enough models to make sure you \nhave addressed all the issues.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "307\nCHAPTER 10 \u25a0 Approaches to System Development\n\u275a\n\u275aBuild High-Quality Models and Get Feedback Rapidly\nNobody likes sloppy work. It is based on faulty thinking and introduces errors. \nOne way to avoid error in models is to get feedback rapidly while the work is \nstill fresh. Feedback comes from users as well as from technical team members. \nOthers will have helpful insights and different ways to view a problem and iden-\ntify a solution.\n\u275a\n\u275aFocus on Content Rather Than Representation\nSometimes, a project team has access to a sophisticated visual modeling tool. \nThese can be helpful, but at times, they are distracting because developers spend \ntime making the diagrams pretty. Be judicious in the use of tools. Some models \nneed to be well drawn for communication or contractual issues. Sometimes, it is \nmore productive to build a model with a tool because it is expected that it will \nbe changed frequently, and using a tool is usually more productive than redraw-\ning by hand. In other cases, a hand-drawn diagram might suffice. Sometimes, \ndevelopers work out a model on a whiteboard in a conference room and take a \ndigital photo to keep a record of the details worked out.\n\u275a\n\u275aLearn from Each Other with Open Communication\nAll the adaptive approaches emphasize working in teams. Don\u2019t be defensive \nabout your models. Other team members have good suggestions. You can never \ntruly master every aspect of a problem or its models.\n\u275a\n\u275aKnow Your Models and How to Use Them\nBeing an Agile modeler doesn\u2019t mean that you aren\u2019t skilled. If anything, you \nmust be more skilled to know the strengths and weaknesses of the models, \nincluding how and when to use them. An expert modeler applies the previous \nprinciples of simplicity, quality, and development of multiple models.\n\u275a\n\u275aAdapt to Specific Project Needs\nEvery project is different because it exists in a unique environment; involves dif-\nferent users, stakeholders, and team members; and requires a different develop-\nment environment and deployment platform. Adapt your models and modeling \ntechniques to fit the needs of the business and the project. Sometimes, models \ncan be informal and simple. For other projects, more formal, complicated mod-\nels might be required. An Agile modeler is able to adapt to each project.\n\u275a\n\u275aMaximize Stakeholder ROI\nThe stakeholders are the real purpose that there is even a project. Stakeholders \ninclude both the users of the new system and those who are funding the development \nof the system. Never lose track of the real reason for the project. The stakeholders \ndeserve to have the final say in what the system does and how it is developed.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The Unified Process, Extreme Programming, \nand\u00a0Scrum\nThe Agile philosophy has proven to be an effective way to approach software \ndevelopment in today\u2019s fast-paced, continually changing landscape of computer \napplications. However, the Agile philosophy only proposes principles; it isn\u2019t \nmeant to be a complete methodology, with practices and action steps. This sec-\ntion presents three methodologies that incorporate Agile principles, but are also \ncomplete methodologies, with specific techniques and practices.\nThese three methodologies\u2014UP, XP, and Scrum\u2014are among the most \npopular approaches to application software development, but they aren\u2019t always \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Frequently, organizations either mix and match \ntechniques from the three or only adopt a specific set of practices. However, \nadoption of these methodologies continues to expand throughout all types of \norganizations that develop software applications.\nThere are other variations of Agile development that are also popular. Each \nhas its own adherents and its own set of principles and practices. Some of these \nother methodologies include Lean Software Development, Kanban Develop-\nment, and Feature Driven Development (FDD). As you move into your career in \nsoftware development, you may have opportunities to learn and practice several \nvariations of Agile development methodologies.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The Unified Process\nThe Unified Process (UP) is an object-oriented system development methodol-\nogy originally offered by Rational Software, which is now part of IBM. Devel-\noped by Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson\u2014the three pioneers \nbehind the success of the Unified Modeling Language (UML)\u2014the UP defines \na complete methodology that uses UML for system models and describes a new, \nadaptive system development life cycle. In the UP, the term development process \nis synonymous with development methodology.\nThe UP is now widely recognized as a highly influential innovation in soft-\nware development methodologies for object-oriented development using an adap-\ntive approach. The original version of UP defined an elaborate set of activities \nand deliverables for every step of the development process. More recent versions \nare streamlined, with fewer activities and deliverables, simplifying the methodol-\nogy. The methodology used in this textbook is an adaptation of UP principles.\nAs discussed previously, adaptive methodologies\u2014including the UP\u2014are all \nbased on an iterative approach to development. You learned in Chapter 1 that \neach iteration is like a mini-project, in which requirements are defined based on \nanalysis tasks, system components are designed, and those components are then \nimplemented\u2014at least partially\u2014through programming and testing. However, \none of the big questions in adaptive development is what the focus of each itera-\ntion should be. In other words, do iterations early in the project have the same \nobjectives and focus as those done later? The UP answers this question by divid-\ning a project into four major phases.\n\u275a\n\u275aUp Phases\nA phase in the UP can be thought of as a goal or major emphasis for a particular \nportion of the project. The four phases of the UP life cycle are inception, elabo-\nration, construction, and transition, as shown in Figure 10-11.\nEach phase of the UP life cycle describes the emphasis or objectives of the proj-\nect team members and their activities at that point in time. Thus, the four phases \nprovide a general framework for planning and tracking the project over time. \nWithin each phase, several iterations are planned to give the team enough flexibil-\nity to adjust to problems or changing conditions. The emphases or objectives of the \nproject team in each of the four phases are described briefly in \u00ad\nFigure 10-12.\nInception Phase\u2003 As in any project-planning phase, the inception phase consists of \nthe project manager developing and refining a vision for the new system in order \nUP system development life cycle\nIteration\nPhase\nInception\nTransition\nElaboration\nConstruction\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nFigure 10-11 The Unified Process \nsystem development life cycle with \nphases and iterations\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Essentially, \nthe project manager makes the business case for the new system, proving that the \nnew system\u2019s benefits will outweigh the cost of development. The scope of the sys-\ntem must also be defined so it is clear what the project will accomplish. Defining \nthe scope includes identifying many of the key requirements for the system.\nThe inception phase is usually completed in one iteration, and as with any \niteration, parts of the actual system may be designed, implemented, and tested. \nAs software is developed, team members must confirm that the system vision \nstill matches user expectations or that the technology will work as planned. \nSometimes, prototypes are discarded after proving that point.\nElaboration Phase\u2003 The elaboration phase usually involves several iterations, and \nearly iterations typically complete the identification and definition of all the sys-\ntem requirements. Because the UP is an adaptive approach to development, the \nrequirements are expected to evolve and change after work starts on the project.\nThe elaboration phase\u2019s iterations also complete the analysis, design, and \nimplementation of the system\u2019s core architecture. Usually, the aspects of the \nsystem that pose the greatest risk are identified and implemented first. Until \ndevelopers know exactly how the highest-risk aspects of the project will work \nout, they can\u2019t determine the amount of effort required to complete the project. \nBy the end of the elaboration phase, the project manager should have more real-\nistic estimates for the project\u2019s cost and schedule, and the business case for the \nproject can be confirmed. Remember that the design, implementation, and test-\ning of key parts of the system are completed during the elaboration phase. One \nother major objective of the elaboration phase is to do the necessary research \nand fact-finding so all the user requirements are identified. During the elabora-\ntion phase, a high percentage of time is spent on understanding and analysis.\nConstruction Phase\u2003 The construction phase involves several iterations that con-\ntinue the design and implementation of the system. The core architecture and \nhighest-risk aspects of the system are already complete. Now the focus of the work \nturns to the routine and predictable parts of the system\u2014for example, detailing \nthe system controls, such as data validation, fine-tuning the user-interface design, \nfinishing routine data maintenance functions, and completing the help and user \npreference functions.

UP disciplines include business modeling, \nrequirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, configuration and \nchange management, project management, and environment. Each iteration usu-\nally involves activities from all disciplines.\nFigure 10-13 shows how the UP disciplines are involved in each iteration, which \nis typically planned to last four weeks. The size of the shaded area under the curve for \neach discipline indicates the relative amount of work included from each discipline \nduring the iteration. This is the same approach to showing work done in each itera-\ntion as the SDLC used throughout this text. The amount and nature of the work dif-\nfers from iteration to iteration. For example, in iteration\u00a02, much of the effort focuses \non business modeling and requirements definition, with much less effort focused on \nimplementation and deployment. In iteration 5, very little effort is focused on model-\ning and requirements and much more effort focused on implementation, testing, and \ndeployment. But most iterations involve some work in all disciplines.\nFigure 10-14 shows the entire UP life cycle: phases, iterations, and disci-\nplines. It includes all the key UP life cycle features and is useful for understand-\ning how a typical information system development project is managed.\nThe previous figures illustrate how the phases include activities from each disci-\npline.

This includes such guidelines as when and how to \nrelease code as well as when and how to manage releases and versions. Project \nmanagement refers to the tasks that are discussed in Chapter 11, such as plan-\nning the iterations, assigning work, and verifying that work has been completed. \nThe environment discipline involves those tasks required to establish the working \nenvironment, including the tools to be used by the team. It also includes those \nguidelines about how to work together in an iterative Agile project.\nAll nine UP disciplines are employed throughout the lifetime of a project \nbut to different degrees. For example, in the inception phase, there is one itera-\ntion. During the inception phase iteration, the project manager might complete \na model showing some aspect of the system environment (the business modeling \ndiscipline). The scope of the system is delineated by defining many of the key \nsystem requirements and listing use cases (the requirements discipline). To prove \ntechnological feasibility, some technical aspect of the system might be designed \n(the design discipline), programmed (the implementation discipline), and tested to \nmake sure it will work as planned (the testing discipline). In addition, the project \nmanager makes plans for handling changes to the project (the configuration and \nchange management discipline), working on a schedule and cost/benefit analysis \n(the project management discipline), and tailoring the UP phases, iterations, deliv-\nerables, and tools to match the needs of the project (the environment discipline).\nThe elaboration phase includes several iterations. In the first iteration, the \nteam works on the details of the domain classes and use cases addressed in \nthe iteration (the business modeling and requirements disciplines).

The use cases addressed in the iteration are designed \nby\u00a0creating design class diagrams and interaction diagrams (the design disci-\npline), programmed using Java or Visual Basic .NET (the implementation dis-\ncipline), and fully tested (the testing discipline). The project manager works on \nthe plan for the next iteration and continues to refine the schedule and feasibility \nassessments (the project management discipline), and all team members continue \nto receive training on the UP activities they are completing and the system devel-\nopment tools they are using (the environment discipline).\nBy the time the project progresses to the construction phase, most of the use \ncases have been designed and implemented in their initial form. The focus of the \nproject turns to satisfying other technical, performance, and reliability require-\nments for each use case, finalizing the design, and implementing the design. \nThese requirements are usually routine and lower risk, but they are key to the \nsuccess of the system. The effort focuses on designing system controls and secu-\nrity and on implementing and testing these aspects.\nAs a system development methodology, the Unified Process must be tailored \nto the development team and the specific project. Choices must be made about \nwhich deliverables to produce and the level of formality, or ceremony, to be \nused. Sometimes, a project requires formal reporting and controls. Other times, \nit can be less formal. The UP should always be tailored to the project, although \nthe UP does tend toward more ceremony than the next two methodologies.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Extreme Programming\nExtreme Programming (XP) is an adaptive, Agile development methodology \nthat was created in the mid-1990s. The word extreme sometimes makes peo-\nple think that this methodology is completely new and that developers who \nembrace XP are radicals. However, XP is really an attempt to take the best \npractices of software development and extend them \u201cto the extreme.\u201d Extreme \nprogramming has these characteristics:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nTakes proven industry best practices and focuses on them intensely\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCombines those best practices (in their most intense forms) in a new way to \nproduce a result that is greater than the sum of its parts\nFigure 10-15 lists the core values and practices of XP. The following sec-\ntions first present the four core values of XP and then explain its 12 primary \npractices. Finally, the basic structure of an XP project and the way XP is used to \ndevelop software is discussed.\n\u275a\n\u275aXP Core Values\nThe four core values of XP\u2014communication, simplicity, feedback, and \n\u00ad\ncourage\u2014drive its practices and project activities. You will recognize the first \nthree as best practices for any development project. You will also notice that \nthe fourth is a desired value for any project, even though it might not be stated \nexplicitly. Here are brief descriptions of the four core values of XP:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCommunication. One of the major causes of project failure is a lack of \nopen communication among the right players at the right time and at the \nright level. Effective communication involves not only documentation, but \nalso verbal discussion. The practices and methods of XP are designed to \nensure that open, frequent communication occurs.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSimplicity. Even though developers have always advocated keeping solutions \nsimple, they don\u2019t always follow their own advice. XP includes techniques to \nreinforce this principle and make it a standard way of developing systems.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFeedback. As with simplicity, getting frequent, meaningful feedback is rec-\nognized as a best practice of software development. Feedback on function-\nality and requirements should come from the users, feedback on designs \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

XP integrates feedback into \nevery aspect of development.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCourage. Developers always need courage to face the harsh choice of doing \nthings right or throwing away bad code and starting over. But all too fre-\nquently, they haven\u2019t had the courage to stand up to a too-tight schedule, \nresulting in bad mistakes. XP practices are designed to give developers the \ncourage to \u201cdo it right.\u201d\n\u275a\n\u275aXP Practices\nXP\u2019s 12 practices embody the basic values just presented. These practices are \nconsistent with the Agile principles explained earlier in this chapter.\nPlanning\u2003 Some people describe XP as glorified hacking or as the old \u201ccode and \nfix\u201d methodology that was used in the 1960s. That isn\u2019t true; XP does include \nplanning. However, as an adaptive technique, it recognizes that you can\u2019t know \neverything at the start. As indicated earlier, XP embraces change. XP planning \nfocuses on making a rough plan quickly and then refining it as things become \nclearer. This reflects the Agile development philosophical dictum that change \nis more important than detailed plans. It is also consistent with the idea that \nindividuals\u2014and their abilities\u2014are more important than an elaborate process.\nThe basis of an XP plan is a set of stories that users develop. A story describes \nwhat the system needs to do. XP doesn\u2019t use the term use case, but a user story \nand a use case express a similar idea. Planning involves two aspects: business \nissues and technical issues. In XP, the business issues are decided by the users and \nclients, whereas technical issues are decided by the development team. The plan, \nespecially in the early stages of the project, consists of the list of stories (from the \nusers) and the estimates of effort, risk, and work dependencies for each story (from \nthe development team). As in Agile development, the idea is to heavily involve the \nusers in the project rather than have them to simply sign off on specifications.\nFigure 10-15 XP core values and \npractices\nPlanning\nRefactoring the\ncode\nSystem metaphor\nSmall releases\nForty-hour week\nCoding standards\nOwning the code\ncollectively\nContinuous\nintegration\nOn-site customer\nTesting\nPair programming\nCommunication\nSimplicity\nFeedback\nCourage\nSimple designs\nXP Core Values\nXP Practices\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "314\nPART 4 \u25a0 System Development and Project Management\nTesting\u2003 Every new piece of software requires testing, and every methodology \nincludes testing. XP intensifies testing by requiring that the tests for each story \nbe written first\u2014before the solution is programmed. There are two major types \nof tests: unit tests, which test the correctness of a small piece of code, and accep-\ntance tests, which test the business function. The developers write the unit tests, \nand the users write the acceptance tests. Before any code can be integrated into \nthe library of the growing system, it must pass the tests. By having the tests \nwritten first, XP automates their use and executes them frequently. Over time, \na library of required tests is created, so when requirements change and the code \nneeds to be updated, the tests can be rerun quickly and automatically.\nPair Programming\u2003 More than any other, this practice is one for which XP is \nfamous. Instead of simply requiring one programmer to watch another\u2019s work, pair \n\u00ad\nprogramming divides up the coding work. First, one programmer might focus more \non design and double-checking the algorithms while the other writes the code. Then, \nthey switch roles; thus, over time, they both think about design, coding, and testing. \nXP relies on comprehensive and continual code reviews. Interestingly, research has \nshown that pair programming is more efficient than programming alone. It takes \nlonger to write the initial code, but the long-term quality is higher. Errors are caught \nquickly and early, two people become familiar with every part of the system, all design \ndecisions are developed by two brains, and fewer \u201cquick and dirty\u201d shortcuts are \ntaken. The quality of the code is always higher in a pair-programming environment.\nSimple Designs\u2003 Opponents say that XP neglects design, but that isn\u2019t true. XP \nconforms to the principles of Agile modeling by avoiding the \u201cBig Design Up \nFront\u201d approach. Instead, it views design as so important that it should be done \ncontinually, although in small chunks. As with everything else, the design must be \nverified immediately by reviewing it along with coding and testing.\nSo, what is a simple design? It is one that accomplishes the desired result \nwith as few classes and methods as possible and that doesn\u2019t duplicate code. \nAccomplishing all that is often a major challenge.\nRefactoring the Code\u2003 Refactoring is the technique of improving the code with-\nout changing what it does. XP programmers continually refactor their code. \nBefore and after adding any new functions, XP programmers review their code \nto see whether there is a simpler design or a simpler method of achieving the \nsame result. Refactoring produces high-quality, robust code.\nOwning the Code Collectively\u2003 In XP, everyone is responsible for the code. No \none person can say, \u201cThis is my code.\u201d Someone can say, \u201cI wrote it,\u201d but every-\none owns it. Collective ownership allows anyone to modify any piece of code. \nHowever, because unit tests are run before and after every change, if program-\nmers see something that needs fixing, they can run the unit tests to make sure \nthe change didn\u2019t break something. This practice embodies the team concept \nthat developers are building a system together.\nContinuous Integration\u2003 This practice embodies XP\u2019s idea of \u201cgrowing\u201d the soft-\nware. Small pieces of code\u2014which have passed the unit tests\u2014are integrated \ninto the system daily or even more often. Continuous integration highlights \nerrors rapidly and keeps the project moving ahead. The traditional approach of \nintegrating large chunks of code late in the project often resulted in tremendous \namounts of rework and time lost while developers tried to determine just what \nwent wrong. XP\u2019s practice of continuous integration prevents that.\nOn-Site Customer\u2003 As with all adaptive approaches, XP projects require contin-\nual involvement of users who can make business decisions about functionality \nand scope. Based on the core value of communication, this practice keeps the \nproject moving ahead rapidly. If the customer isn\u2019t ready to commit resources to \nthe project, the project won\u2019t be very successful.\npair programming\u2003 XP practice in which \ntwo programmers work together on designing, \ncoding, and testing software\nrefactoring\u2003 revising, reorganizing, and \nrebuilding part of a system so it is of higher \nquality\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "315\nCHAPTER 10 \u25a0 Approaches to System Development\nSystem Metaphor\u2003 This practice is XP\u2019s unique and interesting approach to defining \nan architectural vision. It answers the questions \u201cHow does the system work?\u201d and \n\u201cWhat are its major components?\u201d And it does it by having the developers iden-\ntify a metaphor for the system. For example, Big Three automaker Chrysler\u2019s payroll \nsystem was built as a production-line metaphor, with its system components using \n\u00ad\nproduction-line terms. Everyone at Chrysler understood a production line, so a pay-\nroll transaction was treated the same way; developers started with a basic transac-\ntion and then applied various processes to complete it. Of course, a system metaphor \nshould be easily understood or well known to the members of the development team. \nIt can guide members toward a vision and help them understand the system.\nSmall Releases\u2003 A release is a point at which the new system can be turned over to \nusers for acceptance testing and even for productive use. Consistent with the entire \nphilosophy of growing the software, small and frequent releases provide upgraded \nsolutions to the users and keep them involved in the project. Frequent releases also \nfacilitate other practices, such as immediate feedback and continual integration.\nForty-Hour Week and Coding Standards\u2003 These final two practices set the tone for \nhow the developers should work. The exact number of hours a developer works \nisn\u2019t the issue. The issue is that the project shouldn\u2019t be a death march that burns \nout every member of the team. Neither should the project be a haphazard coding \nexercise. Developers should follow standards for coding and documentation. XP \nuses just the engineering principles that are appropriate for an adaptive process \nbased on empirical controls.\n\u275a\n\u275aXP Project Activities\nFigure 10-16 shows an overview of the XP system development approach.

Each \nrelease is a fully functional system that performs a subset of the full system \nrequirements. A release is developed and tested within a period of no more than \na few weeks or months. The activities in the middle ring cycle \u00ad\nmultiple times\u2014\nonce for each release. Releases are divided into multiple iterations. During each \niteration, developers code and test a specific functional subset of a release. Itera-\ntions are coded and tested in a few days or weeks. There are multiple iterations \nwithin each release, so the iteration ring (inner) cycles multiple times.\nThe first XP development activity is creating user stories, which are similar \nto use cases in object-oriented analysis. A team of developers and users quickly \ndocuments all the user stories the system will support. Developers then create a \nclass diagram to represent objects of interest within the user stories.\nDevelopers and users then create a set of acceptance tests for each user story. \nReleases that pass the acceptance tests are considered finished. The final system-\nlevel activity is to create a development plan for a series of releases. The first \nrelease supports a subset of the user stories, and subsequent releases add support \nfor additional stories. Each release is delivered to users and performs real work, \nthus providing an additional level of testing and feedback.\nThe first release-level activity is planning a series of iterations. Each itera-\ntion focuses on a small (possibly just one) system function or user story. The \niterations\u2019 small size allows developers to code and test them within a few days. \nA typical release is developed by using from a few to a few dozen iterations.\nAfter the iteration plan is complete, work begins on the first iteration-level \nactivity. Code units are divided among multiple programming teams, and each \nteam develops and tests its own code. XP recommends a test-first approach to \ncoding. Test code is written before system code. As code modules pass unit test-\ning, they are combined into larger units for integration testing. When an itera-\ntion passes integration testing, work begins on the next iteration.\nWhen all iterations of a release have been completed, the release undergoes \nacceptance testing. If a release fails acceptance testing, the team returns it to the \niteration level for repair. Releases that pass acceptance testing are delivered to \nend users, and work begins on the next release. When acceptance testing of the \nfinal release is completed, the development project is finished.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Scrum\nThose of you who are familiar with rugby are aware that when a team gets pos-\nsession of the ball, it attempts to go the entire distance in one continuous play\u2014\nfrom point of possession to the score. The team works together, passing the ball \nback and forth; even when tackled, it can maintain possession and keep the ball \nin play. Originally, this \u201crugby\u201d approach was applied to product development.\nOne interesting element in rugby is a scrum, which is used to get a ball \nback into play after a penalty. The defining characteristics of a scrum are that it \nbegins quickly, is a very intense effort, involves the entire team, and usually only \nlasts for a short duration.\nCombining some of these principles of rugby with the Agile philosophy gave \nrise to a methodology\u2014the objective of which is to be quick, agile, and intense \nand to go the entire distance. This methodology is referred to as the Scrum \napproach. Over time, the techniques have been refined to fit into a powerful \nadaptive software development methodology. Figure 10-17 illustrates an over-\nview of the Scrum approach. There are three important Scrum areas to under-\nstand: the philosophy, the organization, and the practices.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Scrum Philosophy\nThe Scrum philosophy is also based on the Agile development principles \ndescribed earlier. Scrum is responsive to a highly changing, dynamic environment \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

In this type of environment, changes are so numerous that \nprojects can bog down and never reach completion. Scrum excels in this type \nof\u00a0situation.\nScrum focuses primarily on the team level. It is a type of social engineering \nthat emphasizes individuals more than processes and describes how teams of \ndevelopers can work together to build software in a series of short mini-projects. \nKey to this philosophy is the complete control a team exerts over its own organi-\nzation and its work processes. Software is developed incrementally, and controls \nare imposed empirically\u2014by focusing on things that can be accomplished.\nThe basic control mechanism for a Scrum project is a list of all the things \nthe system should include and address. This list\u2014called the product backlog \nincludes user functions (such as use cases), features (such as security), and tech-\nnology (such as platforms). The product backlog list is continually being pri-\noritized, and only a few of the high-priority items are worked on at a time, \naccording to the current needs of the project and its sponsor.\n\u275a\n\u275aScrum Organization\nThe three main organizational elements that affect a Scrum project are the \nproduct owner, the Scrum master, and the Scrum team or teams.\nThe product owner is the client, but he or she has additional responsi-\nbilities. Remember that in Agile development, the user and client are closely \ninvolved in the project. In Scrum, the product owner maintains the product \nbacklog list. For any function to be included in the final system, it must first \nbe placed on the product backlog. Because the product owner maintains that \nlist, any request must first be approved and agreed to by the product owner. In \ntraditional development projects, the project team initiates the interviews and \nother activities to identify and define requirements. In a Scrum project, the pri-\nmary client controls the requirements. This forces the client and user to be inti-\nmately involved in the project.

One of the primary duties of the Scrum master is to remove impediments \nso the team can do its work. In other words, the Scrum master is a facilitator.\nThe Scrum team is a small group of developers\u2014typically five to nine \npeople\u2014who work together to produce the software. For projects that are \nvery large, the work should be partitioned and delegated to smaller teams. If \nnecessary, the Scrum masters from all the teams can coordinate multiple team \nactivities.\nThe Scrum team sets its own goal for what it can accomplish in a specific \nperiod of time. It then organizes itself and parcels out the work to members. In a \nsmall team, it is much easier to sit around a table, decide what needs to be done, \nand have members of the team volunteer or accept pieces of work.\n\u275a\n\u275aScrum Practices\nThe Scrum practices are the mechanics of how a project progresses. Of course, \nthe practices are based on the Scrum philosophy and organization. The basic \nwork process is called a sprint, and all other practices are focused on support-\ning a sprint.\nA Scrum sprint is a firm period called a time box, with a specific goal or \ndeliverable. At the beginning of a sprint, the team gathers for a one-day plan-\nning session. In this session, the team decides on the major goal for the sprint. \nThe goal draws from several items on the prioritized product backlog list. The \nteam decides how many of the highest-priority items it can accomplish within \nthe sprint. Sometimes, lower-priority items can be included for very little addi-\ntional effort and can be added to the deliverables for the sprint.\nAfter the team has agreed on a goal and has selected items from the back-\nlog list, it begins work. The scope of that sprint is then frozen, and no one can \nchange it\u2014neither the product owner nor any other users. If users do find new \nfunctions they want to add, they put them on the product backlog list for the \nnext sprint. If team members determine that they can\u2019t accomplish everything in \ntheir goal, they can reduce the scope for that sprint. However, the time period is \nkept constant.\nEvery day during the sprint, the Scrum master holds a daily Scrum, which \nis a meeting of all members of the team. The objective is to report progress. The \nmeeting is limited to 15 minutes or some other short time period. Members of \nthe team answer only three questions:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWhat have you done since the last daily Scrum (during the last 24 hours)?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWhat will you do by the next daily Scrum?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWhat kept you or is keeping you from completing your work?\nThe purpose of this meeting is simply to report issues, not to solve them. \nIndividual team members collaborate and resolve problems after the meeting \nas part of the normal workday. One of the major responsibilities of the Scrum \nmaster is to note the impediments and see that they are removed. A good Scrum \nmaster clears impediments rapidly. The Scrum master also protects the team \nfrom any intrusions. The team members are then free to accomplish their work. \nTeam members do talk with users to obtain requirements, and users are involved \nin the sprint\u2019s work. However, users can\u2019t change the items being worked on \nfrom the backlog list or change the intended scope of any item without putting \nit on the backlog list.\nAt the end of each sprint, the agreed-on deliverable is produced. A final \nhalf-day review meeting is scheduled to recap progress and identify changes \nthat need to be made for the following sprints. By time-boxing these activities\u2014\nthe planning, the sprint, the daily Scrum, and the Scrum review\u2014the process \nbecomes a well-defined template to which the team easily conforms, which con-\ntributes to the success of Scrum projects.\nsprint\u2003 a time-controlled mini-project that \nimplements a specific portion of a system\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Agile modeling describes principles for keeping \na project\u00a0agile.\nThe most formal adaptive, Agile development \nmethodology is the Unified Process (UP). It was one of \nthe first methodologies to be formalized with specific \ndefinitions for iterations and processes. Other more \nradical adaptive, agile methodologies are now being \npromoted and used. Two of the more popular ones are \nExtreme Programming and Scrum.\nExtreme Programming (XP) and Scrum are meth-\nodologies that embody the most Agile principles. Two \ncore elements of XP are that system tests are written \nfirst and that programmers work in pairs to design, \ncode, and test the software. Thus, when a function is \ncompleted, it has not only been designed and coded, \nbut it has also been reviewed and tested.\nThe Scrum approach defines a specific goal that \ncan be completed within a short sprint. During that \nsprint, the project team is protected from all outside \ndistractions so it can complete the defined goal. A \nproduct backlog of all outstanding requests is main-\ntained by the client, and changes to the work the team \nis doing are only allowed between sprints.\nSystem development projects are organized around a \nsystem development life cycle (SDLC). Some SDLCs \nare based on a more predictive approach to the proj-\nect, and other SDLCs are based on a more adaptive ap-\nproach. The predictive approach to the SDLC includes \nphases that are completed sequentially or with some \noverlap. The traditional SDLC phases are project ini-\ntialization, project planning, analysis, design, imple-\nmentation, deployment, and support. The adaptive \napproach to the SDLC is used when the requirements \nor technology are less certain and it is difficult to plan \neverything about the project in advance. Adaptive \nSDLCs use multiple iterations that allow the analysis, \ndesign, and implementation of smaller parts of the ap-\nplication to be completed and evaluated. The SDLC \nused in this text is an example of an adaptive SDLC, \nand the six core processes correspond to the phases of \nthe traditional predictive SDLC. All development proj-\nects use an SDLC to manage the project, but there is \nmore to system development than the SDLC. Models, \ntechniques, and tools make up a system development \nmethodology that provides guidelines for completing \nevery activity in the SDLC.\nAgile development, the leading trend in system \ndevelopment, helps keep system development projects \nresponsive to change.

By now, you may be asking yourself such \nquestions as:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHow are all these activities coordinated?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHow do I know which tasks to do first?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHow is the work assigned to the different teams and team members?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHow do I know which parts of the new system should be developed first?\nThe purpose of project planning and project management is to bring some \norder to all these (sometimes seemingly unrelated) tasks. As you will learn in \nthis chapter, the success of any given project highly depends on the skills and \nabilities of those managing the project. You will also learn that project manage-\nment skills aren\u2019t only for project managers\u2014that all the project team members \ncontribute to the management of the project and thus to its success.\nThis chapter first discusses the need for project management and the prin-\nciples associated it. The rest of this chapter discusses the detailed activities that \nare associated with the first two core processes of system development, both of \nOpening case\u2002 Blue Sky Mutual Funds: A New Development Approach\nJim Williams, vice president of finance for Blue Sky \nMutual Funds, spoke first. \u201cThere are some things I like \nabout this new approach, but other things worry me,\u201d \nhe told Gary Johnson, the company\u2019s director of infor-\nmation technology.\n\u201cThis idea of \u2018growing\u2019 the system through several \niterations makes a lot of sense to me. It is always hard \nfor my people to know exactly what they need a new \ninformation system to do and what will work best for the \ncompany. So, if they can get their hands on the system \nearly, they can begin acceptance testing and try it out to \nsee whether it addresses their needs in the best way.\u201d\n\u201cLet me see if I understand the big picture, though. \nYour development team and my investment advisors will \ndecide on a few core processes that the system needs \nto support and then your team will design and build a \nsystem to support those core processes. You will do \nthat in a mini-project that will last about six weeks. Then, \nyou will continue adding more functionality through sev-\neral other mini-projects until the system is complete and \nfunctioning well. Is that right?\u201d\nJim was becoming more enthusiastic about this \nnew approach to system development.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s the basic idea,\u201d Gary said. \u201cYour users \nneed to understand that the first few versions of the \nsystem won\u2019t be complete and may not be completely \nrobust either. But these early versions will give them \nsomething to work with and try out. We also need good \nfeedback from their acceptance testing so the system \nwill be thoroughly tested by the time we are through.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that,\u201d Jim said. \u201cMy people will like not hav-\ning to think from the very beginning about everything they \nneed the system to do. They\u2019ll like being able to try things \nout. As I said earlier, I like this approach. However, the part \nI don\u2019t like about this approach is that it will be more dif-\nficult for you to give me a firm time schedule and project \ncost. That worries me. In the past, those have been two \nof the major tools we used to monitor a project\u2019s progress. \nAre you saying that now we won\u2019t have a schedule at all? \nAnd you want an open budget?\u201d Jim frowned.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it first sounds,\u201d Gary said. \u201cThis \napproach is an \u2018adaptive\u2019 approach, by which I mean \nthat because the system is growing, the project is more \nopen ended. The project manager will still create a \nschedule and estimate the project costs, but she won\u2019t \neven try to identify and lock in all the required function-\nality for several of the iterations. Because the system\u2019s \nscope is going to continually be refined over the first few \niterations, there is the risk of \u2018scope creep.\u2019 That is one \nof the biggest risks with adaptive approaches. You and I \nshould meet with the project manager fairly frequently \nto ensure that the scope is controlled and the project \ndoesn\u2019t get out of control.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jim said. \u201cYou have convinced me to try \nthis new approach. However, let\u2019s treat this project as \na pilot and see how it works. If it\u2019s successful, we will \nconsider using this iterative approach on our other proj-\nects.\u201d Jim and Gary agreed that a pilot was the best way \nto get started. Gary then headed off to meet with the \nproject manager and get the project started.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The purpose of this chapter \nis to teach you how to plan, organize, and direct a system development project.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Principles of Project Management\nMany of you may have built a Web page with HTML or written a computer \nprogram for yourself or a friend. In those cases, where it was just you work-\ning, you weren\u2019t too concerned about how to organize your work or how to \nmanage the project. However, as soon as two or more developers are working \ntogether, the work must be partitioned and organized, with specific assignments \nfor each developer. This is true whether the project uses a predictive approach or \nan adaptive approach. As discussed in the last chapter, the chosen methodology \nlays out a complex set of activities and tasks that must be carefully managed. \nFailing to organize usually causes wasted time and effort as well as confusion \nand may even cause the project to fail.\nEven though every project team designates one person as the project manager, \nwith primary responsibility for the way the team functions, all members contrib-\nute to the team\u2019s management. The project manager for the RMO \u00ad\nConsolidated \nSales and Marketing System (CSMS) project is Barbara Halifax, but she has a \nsenior systems analyst helping her every step of the way. As the project proceeds, \nall team members are involved in aspects of managing the project.\nAs discussed in earlier chapters, a project is a planned undertaking with a \nbeginning and an end, which produces a predetermined result and is usually \nconstrained by a schedule and resources. The development of information sys-\ntems fits this definition. In addition, it is usually a quite complex project, with \nmany people and tasks that have to be organized and coordinated. Whatever \nits objective, each project is unique. Different products are produced, different \nactivities are required with varying schedules, and different resources are used. \nThis uniqueness makes information systems projects difficult to control.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The Need for Project Management\nHistory is replete with stories of software development projects that go awry. Prob-\nably one of the most visible examples of a less-than-successful development project \nwas the Affordable Care Act enrollment system\u2014frequently referred to as Obam-\nacare. Even though it was reported on the news media that the only problem was \nthat it could not handle the volume of traffic, more in-depth evaluation uncovered \nseveral serious flaws. According to Ben Simo, the past president of the Association \nfor Software Testing, there were other serious problems. One small example:\n\u201cIn mid-October, he went to Healthcare.gov to help a family mem-\nber get insurance, only to find his progress blocked. When he inves-\ntigated the cause, he discovered that one part of the website had \ncreated so much \u2018cookie\u2019 tracking data that it appeared to exceed the \nsite\u2019s capacity to accept his login information. \u00a0That\u2019s the mark of a frac-\ntured development team.\u201d (http://swampland.time.com/2013/10/24/\ntraffic-didnt-crash-the-obamacare-site-alone-bad-coding-did-too/)\nA \u201cfractured development team\u201d really means that the project manager and \nteam leaders were unable to manage the project. Admittedly, it was a giant proj-\nect under a very tight deadline with many diverse stakeholders\u2014as are many \nsoftware projects.\nThere are a number of organizations that study software development to eval-\nuate success rates and to identify best practices. Software development success is \noften measured using three criteria: finishing on time, finishing within budget, \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

At that \ntime, the results were dismal. One-third of all projects ended up as failed proj-\nects that were canceled. Fully one-half of projects were challenged and were late, \noverbudget, and often with reduced functionality. Only about 15 percent were \nconsidered successful.\nOver the last 20 years, there has been a major effort to improve these num-\nbers. You learned in the previous chapter about new development paradigms \nthat are easier to manage and respond better to users\u2019 needs. Figure 11-1 illus-\ntrates success rates based on several different types of development paradigms. \nEven though the success has improved substantially, billions of dollars are still \nspent on projects that don\u2019t meet their objectives.\nMany of these studies and reports don\u2019t just indicate the rate of informa-\ntion technology (IT) project failure or success. They also identify the reasons for \neach. Here are some of the primary reasons for failure:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUndefined project management practices\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPoor IT management and poor IT procedures\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nInadequate executive support for the project\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nInexperienced project managers\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUnclear business needs and project objectives\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nInadequate user involvement\nIt is notable that the primary reasons projects fail are a lack of executive \ninvolvement and a lack of management skills. The other major reason is lack of \ninvolvement by the user community. In other words, projects don\u2019t tend to fail \nfor lack of programming skills or enthusiastic developers.\nFor an IT project to be successful, strong IT management and business direc-\ntion need to be present. The other major element in all project success is sound \nproject management procedures as well as experienced and competent project \nmanagers. In fact, good project managers always ensure that they have received \nclear directives from business executives and committed user involvement with \nthe requirements for the new system. Substantial research and improvement \nhave also occurred in project management approaches. You will learn about spe-\ncific project management techniques that improve project success.\nFigure 11-1 Project success rates \nfor various development paradigms\nDevelopment paradigm\nSuccessful\nChallenged\nFailed\nAd hoc\nTraditional\nLean\nAgile\nIterative\n50%\n49%\n72%\n64%\n65%\n35%\n32%\n21%\n30%\n28%\n15%\n18%\n7%\n6%\n7%\nSource: http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-non-existent-software-crisis-debunki/ \n240165910.\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "329\nCHAPTER 11 \u25a0 Project Planning and Project Management\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 The Role of the Project Manager\nProject management is organizing and directing other people to achieve a planned \nresult within a predetermined schedule and budget. At the beginning of a project, \na plan is developed that specifies the activities that must take place, the deliverables \nthat must be produced, and the resources that are needed. Even though the project \nplan is quite different depending on whether a predictive traditional approach is \nused or whether an adaptive approach is used, successful projects always have some \ntype of project plan. Project management can also be defined as the processes or \nactivities used to plan the project and then to monitor and control it.\nOne of the most exciting careers for IT-oriented people is being a project man-\nager. As projects become more complex because of shorter time frames, distrib-\nuted project teams (including offshore and cross-cultural teams), rapidly changing \ntechnology, and more sophisticated requirements, highly qualified project manag-\ners are sought after and paid well. Many universities have added project manage-\nment courses to their curricula to respond to the needs of the industry. There is \na strong need and a high demand for people who are capable project managers. \nAs your career progresses, you should develop your management skills. You may \neven want to become active in the Project Management \u00ad\nInstitute (PMI), which is \nthe most well-known professional organization for project managers.\nOverall, project managers must be effective internally (managing people \nand resources) and externally (conducting public relations). Internally, the proj-\nect manager serves as locus of control for the project team and all its activities. \nHe or she establishes the team\u2019s structure so work can be accomplished. This list \nidentifies a few of these internal responsibilities:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDeveloping the project schedule\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nRecruiting and training team members\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAssigning work to teams and team members\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAssessing project risks\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMonitoring and controlling project deliverables and milestones\nExternally, the project manager is the main contact for the project. He or \nshe must represent the team to the outside world and communicate the team \nmembers\u2019 needs. Major external responsibilities include:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReporting the project\u2019s status and progress\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWorking directly with the client (the project\u2019s sponsor) and other \nstakeholders\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIdentifying resource needs and obtaining resources\nIn Chapter 2, you learned about the various stakeholders of a system. These \nstakeholders were divided into internal stakeholders, which are those inside the \norganization, and external stakeholders, which are those outside of the orga-\nnization. Drilling down to a more detailed level, you can identify those people \nwho are part of the project team and work for the project manager, and those \nstakeholders who do not. Among the people who are not part of the project \nteam are several groups of people that the project manager must interact with.\nFirst, there is the client (i.e., the customer), who pays for the development \nof the new system. Project approval and the release of funds come from the cli-\nent. For in-house developments, the client may be an executive committee or a \nvice president. The client approves and oversees the project, along with its fund-\ning. For large, mission-critical projects, an oversight committee (sometimes \ncalled the steering committee) may be formed. This consists of clients and other \nkey executives who have a vision of the organization\u2019s strategic direction and \na strong interest in the project\u2019s success. On the other hand, the users are the \npeople who will actually use the new system. The user typically provides infor-\nmation about the detailed functions and operations needed in the new system.\nproject management\u2003 organizing and \ndirecting other people to achieve a planned \nresult within a predetermined schedule \nand\u00a0budget\nclient\u2003 the person or group that funds the \nproject\noversight committee\u2003 clients and key \nmanagers who review the progress and direct \nthe project\nusers\u2003 the person or group of people who \nwill use the new system\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Similarly, working with the \nteam leaders, team members, internal technical staff, and any subcontractors is an \nimportant part of a project manager\u2019s internal responsibilities. The\u00a0project man-\nager must ensure that all internal and external communication is flowing properly. \nFigure 11-2 depicts the various groups of people involved in a development project.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Project Management and Ceremony\nAnother dimension that has a heavy impact on project management is the level \nof formality, sometimes called ceremony, required for a given project. Level of \nformality or ceremony is a measure of the amount of documentation gener-\nated, the traceability of specifications, and the formality of the project\u2019s deci-\nsion-making processes. Some projects, particularly small ones, are conducted \nwith very low ceremony. Meetings occur in the hallway or around the water \ncooler. Written documentation, formal specifications, and detailed models are \nkept to a minimum. Developers and users usually work closely together on a \ndaily basis to define requirements and develop the system. Other projects, usu-\nally larger, more complex ones, are executed with high ceremony. Meetings \nare often held on a predefined schedule, with specific participants, agendas, \nminutes, and follow-through.

However, even though the approach and ceremony are different, \nlarge predictive projects often tend to have high ceremony, with lots of meet-\nings and documentation. Unfortunately, the extensive documentation tended to \nincrease the length of the project and sometimes contributed to cost overruns. \nTechniques such as rapid application development (RAD) were utilized to help \nmanage large predictive projects with less formality. This approach required less \ndocumentation and fewer status and review meetings. Of course, many smaller \nprojects were often managed with less ceremony.\nAdaptive projects can also be more or less formal in the way they are man-\naged. The Unified Process, which was explained in Chapter 10, is quite formal, \nwith high ceremony. Each iteration is precisely defined, with such specific out-\ncomes as specifications, diagrams, prototypes, and deliverables. However, other \nadaptive approaches, such as lean, iterative, or Agile methods, lend themselves \nto being managed with much less formality. The inherent characteristics of an \niterative approach, with its \u201cjust in time\u201d project plans, easily adjust to less doc-\numentation, fewer diagrams for specifications, and less-formal status reporting.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)\nThe PMI is a professional organization that promotes project management, \nprimarily within the United States but also throughout the world. In addition, \nprofessional organizations in other countries promote project management. The \nPMI has a well-respected and rigorous certification program, and many corpo-\nrations encourage their project managers to become certified.\nAs part of its mission, the PMI has defined a body of knowledge for project \nmanagement. This body of knowledge, referred to as the project management \nbody of knowledge (PMBOK), is a widely accepted foundation of informa-\ntion that every project manager should know.

However, one of the concerns with them is that they \nimply a working environment that has no controls or plans\u2014one that can turn \ninto pure chaos. Chapter 10 also introduced a term, chaordic, that describes a \nproject that expects and allows chaos while remaining controlled or ordered.\nOne of the major challenges of Agile project management is how best to \nbalance the flexibility and chaos of an Agile team with the order and control \nneeded for a project. More than anything else, Agile project management is a \nway of balancing these two conflicting requirements: how to be agile and flex-\nible while maintaining control of the project schedule, budget, and deliverables. \nIn recent years, several implementations of Agile principles have appeared in the \nform of specific methodologies, each with their own set of principles, such as \nScrum and Lean.\nTo help you understand Agile project management better, the following sec-\ntions discuss five of the ten knowledge areas of the PMBOK and discuss the \nissues involved in implementing them by using Agile principles.\n\u275a\n\u275aAgile Scope Management\nScope management refers to the scope of the new system and the scope of the \nproject. In traditional predictive projects, the project manager and the team \nattempted to define the scope in both areas at the beginning of the project, dur-\ning the planning phase. Unfortunately, for most new systems, there were so \nmany unknowns that the scope was almost never defined accurately. The Agile \nphilosophy accepts the fact that the scope isn\u2019t well understood and that there \nwill be many changes, updates, and refinements to the requirements as the proj-\nect progresses. However, uncontrolled scope can result in a project that never \nfinishes, even if it is an Agile project. The project manager must have a pro-\ncess and mechanisms in place to control the scope of the project. How can this \nbe\u00a0done?\nLet us assume that one of the major outcomes of the planning iteration was \nthe decision to develop a prioritized list of business requirements that the new \nsystem needs to support. Figure 11-4 represents this list, with the higher-prior-\nity items toward the top and the lower-priority items toward the bottom. These \nrequirements can be prioritized by using several criteria, including importance \nto the business, risk, complexity, size, and other dependencies. In most proj-\nects, some combination of these criteria is used to prioritize the requirements. \n\u00ad\nFigure\u00a011-4 also indicates that the project team has made a preliminary assign-\nment of these requirements to iterations. As new requirements are defined, they \nare prioritized, inserted into the stack, and assigned to an iteration.\nControlling the scope is a decision made by the client, with input provided by \nthe project team and the users. With an iterative project, a deliverable is usually \nprovided at the end of each iteration. Because the system is growing throughout \nthe project, with the highest-priority requirements implemented first, the client \nis able to shut down the project when he or she feels that the system is complete \nenough to satisfy the business need. Most projects usually require one or two \nmore iterations to do final integration and testing to ensure that the system will \nscale for high volume and that it meets all the \u201chardening\u201d requirements for \nsecurity purposes.\n\u275a\n\u275aAgile Time Management\nTraditional time management is primarily concerned with scheduling tasks: cre-\nating the schedule, assigning work according to the schedule, and monitoring \nprogress against the schedule. In predictive projects, the schedule is created dur-\ning the initial planning phase and entered into a project scheduling system, such \nas Microsoft Project.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "334\nPART 4 \u25a0 System Development and Project Management\nIn an Agile project, because the requirements are always changing, it can be \nvery difficult to create and maintain a meaningful project schedule. The \u00ad\ninitial \nplanning effort will usually include the beginning set of requirements and divide \nthe project into iterations, with a preliminary assignment of requirements to\u00a0iter-\nations. However, it is expected that the number of iterations and the assignments \nwill change as new requirements are discovered and put on the prioritized stack.\nWithin an iteration, which often lasts from two to four weeks, a more \ndetailed schedule can be developed. The Agile philosophy includes the idea that \nonly for small work projects, in which the tasks are performed at nearly the \nsame time (i.e., within one iteration), can a meaningful schedule be developed. In \naddition, the project team, not the project manager or team leader, will schedule \nits own work. Thus, for an Agile project, each iteration is usually planned as the \nfirst task within the iteration. The tasks are identified, estimates of the effort are \ndeveloped, and work is assigned by the project team members. Because there are \nso many iterations in a project, the project team gets lots of practice and quickly \nbecomes proficient at estimating and scheduling the work.\n\u275a\n\u275aAgile Cost Management\nIt is normal for the client stakeholder to ask, \u201cHow long will it take and how \nmuch will it cost for this new system to be developed?\u201d These questions are \nhard to answer. For predictive projects, the project manager gives estimates, \nbut as you saw earlier, these are usually incorrect. Agile project managers \nadmit more readily that time and cost estimates are difficult to make, \u00ad\nespecially \nwith\u00a0a project in which the requirements are expected to change through-\nout. Hence, estimating the project\u2019s cost isn\u2019t as important as controlling the \nHigh-priority functions\nLow-priority functions\nIteration 1\nNew required functions\ncan be inserted\nExisting functions can be\nremoved or reprioritized\nIteration 2\nIteration 3\nIteration 4\nIteration 5\nFigure 11-4 Scope management \nwith changing requirements\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The project manager\u2019s responsibility to \n\u00ad\ncontrol costs is just as important for an Agile project as it is for a traditional \n \npredictive project.\n\u275a\n\u275aAgile Risk Management\nIn most adaptive, iterative projects, including Agile projects, close attention is \ngiven to project risks, particularly technical risks. Iterative projects are often \nrisk-driven, meaning that early iterations focus specifically on addressing the \nmost critical project risks. Although a similar emphasis on risk can be included \nin a predictive project, it is more difficult to integrate specific risk-reducing \nactivities into the project schedule. The major difference between the two types \nof projects is that in predictive projects, separate prototypes are built, whereas \nin adaptive projects, the high-risk portions of the new system are built first.\n\u275a\n\u275aAgile Quality Management\nUsually, quality management has to do with the quality of the deliverable from \nthe project. However, in an Agile project, you also consider the quality of the \nprocess. How well is the project working, and how well do the internal proce-\ndures promote project success?\nIn a predictive project, the final set of tasks consists of the system test, the \nintegration test, and the user acceptance test. However, scheduling these exten-\nsive tests at the end of the project renders it very difficult and expensive to make \nthe necessary changes. An alternative is to deploy the system with minimal test-\ning, which helps the budget but can cause many problems for the company.\nIn an Agile project, each iteration has a deliverable. Often, each iteration \nalso integrates a new piece into the growing total system. Within each iteration, \nthe new pieces are tested by themselves and as integrated with the rest of the \nsystem. The users also get involved in testing the system\u2019s ability to meet their \nbusiness needs. Hence, testing and quality control are spread across the entire \nproject and usually provide a better-tested and more robust system.\nAnother kind of quality control that should be done as part of an Agile \nproject is a process evaluation at the end of each iteration. In other words, the \nproject team does a self-evaluation to figure out how well it did and what could \nbe done to improve the next iteration.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Activities of Core Process 1: Identify the Problem \nand Obtain Approval\nChapter 1 introduced you to the basic principles of iterative development using \nsix core processes. In fact, the core processes are applicable to either a predic-\ntive approach or an adaptive approach. As explained in the last chapter, with a \npredictive approach, the core processes are performed in a waterfall sequence. In \nan iterative approach, these core processes are performed multiple times\u2014dur-\ning each iteration. Obviously, some overall project planning must be done at \nthe initiation of the project, but detailed project planning, as well as execution, \ncontinues throughout the project.\nSo far in the text, you have learned the detailed activities of Core Process 3 \n \n(\u201cDiscover and understand details\u201d) and Core Process 4 (\u201cDesign system com-\nponents\u201d). This chapter discusses the activities of Core Processes 1 and 2. \nWe\u00a0elected to discuss the concepts of project management until after you had \nsome experience in the details of project development work. In other words, \nyour ability to understand the need and importance of project management is \nenhanced by having experience with the kind of work that must be managed. \nIn\u00a0later chapters, you will learn the details of the final two core processes.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "336\nPART 4 \u25a0 System Development and Project Management\nCore Process 1 is probably the most critical process for project success. \nAs\u00a0was noted earlier in the chapter, establishing such things as strong executive \nsupport, clear business case and direction, and effective planning is critical to \nproject success. These important factors are identified and resolved during the \nactivities of Core Process 1. Figure 11-5 highlights the four activities associated \nwith Core Process 1.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Identify the Problem\nInformation systems development projects are initiated for various reasons, \nincluding (1) to respond to an opportunity, (2) to resolve a problem, and (3) to \nrespond to an external directive.\nMost companies are continually looking for ways to increase their market \nshares or open up new markets. One way they create opportunities is with stra-\ntegic plans\u2014short term and long term. In many ways, planning is the optimal \nway to identify new projects. As the strategic plans are developed, projects are \nidentified, prioritized, and scheduled.\nProjects are also initiated to resolve immediate business problems. Such \nprojects can be initiated as part of a strategic plan, but they are more com-\nmonly requested by middle managers who want to take care of some difficulty \nin the company\u2019s operations. Sometimes, these needs are so critical that they are \nbrought to the attention of the strategic planning committee and integrated into \nthe overall business strategy. At other times, an immediate need can\u2019t wait, such \nas a new sales commission schedule or a new report needed to assess productiv-\nity. In these cases, managers of business functions will request the initiation of \nindividual development projects.\nFinally, projects are initiated to respond to outside directives. One common \nversion of this is legislative changes that require new information gathering and \nreporting\u2014for example, changes in tax laws and labor laws. Legislative changes \ncan also expand or contract the range of services and products that an organiza-\ntion can offer in a market. For example, recent changes in health insurance with \nthe Affordable Care Act have required insurance companies to modify exist-\ning systems and add new systems to interface with government systems and the \nHealth Insurance Marketplace.\nIdentifying and carefully defining the problem is a critical activity for a suc-\ncessful project. The objective is to ensure that the new system actually meets the \nbusiness need. The purpose is to precisely define the business problem and deter-\nmine the scope of the new system. This activity defines the target you want to hit. \nIdentify problem activities\nIdentify the problem.\nQuantify project approval factors.\nPerform risk and feasibility analysis.\nReview with the client and obtain approval.\nCore\nprocesses\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nIdentify the problem and obtain\napproval.\nPlan and monitor the project.\nDiscover and understand details.\nDesign system components.\nBuild, test, and integrate system\ncomponents.\nComplete system tests and deploy\nthe solution.\nIterations\nFigure 11-5 Activities of Core Process 1\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "337\nCHAPTER 11 \u25a0 Project Planning and Project Management\nIf the target is ill defined, all subsequent activities will lack focus. For example, a \nrequest might be made for a system that would \u201ckeep track of salesperson com-\nmissions.\u201d Without knowing more about the context surrounding this request, a \nsystem could be built that only records the commissions, ignoring the complexi-\nties of tax reporting, internal-versus-outside salespersons, deferred commissions, \ncomplex relationships, shared commissions, and so forth. Thus, even though \nall the specifications may not be defined in this initial activity, enough defining \nneeds to be done to understand the implications of the required solution.\nAn effective way to define the problem is to develop a System Vision \n\u00ad\nDocument, which was introduced in Chapter 1. There are three components to \nthis document: the problem description, the anticipated business benefits, and \nthe system capabilities.\nThe first task in developing a System Vision Document is to review the busi-\nness needs that initiated the project. If the project was initiated as part of the \nstrategic plan, then the planning documents need to be reviewed. If the project \noriginated from departmental needs, then key users need to be consulted to help \nthe project team understand the business need. From this task, a brief problem \ndescription is developed. As these needs are identified, the team also develops \na detailed list of the expected business benefits. The list of business benefits \ncontains the results that the organization anticipates it will accrue from a new \nsystem. Business benefits are normally described in terms of the specific results \nthat can change the financial statements, either by decreasing costs or increasing \nrevenues.\nAs the business benefits are being identified, the project team will identify \nthe new system\u2019s specific capabilities to support the realization of these benefits. \nThe objective of this task is to define the scope of the problem in terms of the \nrequirements for the information system. This scoping statement, as defined by \na list of system capabilities, helps identify the size and complexity of the new \nsystem and the project that will be required.\nMembers of the development team, working with the users and the client, \ncombine these three components\u2014the problem description, the business ben-\nefits, and the system capabilities\u2014into a System Vision Document. Figure 11-6 \npresents RMO\u2019s System Vision Document. Note the differences between the \nbusiness benefits and the system capabilities. The business benefits focus on the \nfinancial benefit to the company. The system capabilities focus on the system \nitself. The benefits are achieved through the capabilities provided by the system.\nRMO\u2019s existing CSS (Customer Support System) was built under a tight \ndeadline, and the company recognized that it would have a fairly short life. \nThere were still many things to learn about Web marketing, but the existing CSS \nwill help the company define the requirements for its CSMS.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Quantify Project Approval Factors\nThe first activity produced a high-level overview document that identified the \nneed for a new system. However, that document alone may not be adequate \nto receive approval and funding. During this second activity, the project team, \nworking with the users, will attempt to define more precisely the scope and \nimpact of the project.\nThe objective is to provide sufficient justification so funds will be released \nand the project can start. Sometimes, the need is so great or so obvious that \nproject approval is almost automatic. In other situations, it may be necessary to \nprepare a thorough cost/benefit analysis.

Customers are more \nsophisticated, and they are used to catalog and sales systems that are easy to use and provide many \nservices, such as one-click ordering, deferred-purchase tracking, simplified searches, and comparison \nshopping. In addition, research has shown that sales increase dramatically when social media marketing \ntools are combined with basic sales functionality. Hence, the new CSMS is needed not only to respond to \ntoday\u2018s competition but also to launch RMO into today\u2018s world of social media and mobile computing. \nThe longer RMO delays in starting this project, the more opportunities it misses. \nSystem Capabilities\nThis document identifies the required system capabilities at a high level. Later documents will specify the\ndetailed requirements. These capabilities are required:\n\u2022  Provide a shopping cart capability.\n   \u2022  Support customer sales with high automation (one-click, etc.).\n   \u2022  Recommend related product purchases and comparison shopping. \n   \u2022  Allow customer ratings and recommendations.\n   \u2022  Include \u201cfriend\u201d network capability.\n\u2022  Include comprehensive order fulfillment.\n   \u2022  Support multiple and split-order shipping and tracking.\n   \u2022  Support back-ordering and tracking.\n   \u2022  Allow customer comments and feedback.\n\u2022  Provide customer account and billing capability. \n   \u2022  Provide individualized customer accounting. \n   \u2022  Support electronic billing and many electronic payment methods.\n   \u2022  Accumulate customer \u201cpoints\u201d and allow transfer and sharing.\n\u2022  Include marketing functions for promotions and specials.\n   \u2022  Provide flexible promotions and sales.\n   \u2022  Accumulate and track \u201cpoints\u201d from suppliers directly to customers.\n   \u2022  Interface with social marketing media for advertising and social marketing activities.\n   \u2022  Support mobile devices for social marketing and sales.\nBusiness Benefits\nThe primary business benefit of these capabilities will be to increase sales by connecting with customers\nand improving the customer experience.

With the more \nadaptive approaches, the stakeholders recognize that the requirements are \nunknown and that it is more important to monitor and control scope, cost, and \nschedule than to try to make detailed estimates.\n\u275a\n\u275aThe Estimated Time for Project Completion\nDuring Core Process 2 (\u201cPlan and monitor the project\u201d), a more detailed project \nschedule is created. During project initiation, there usually isn\u2019t enough known \nabout the project to create a schedule. But there is nevertheless a need to esti-\nmate the project\u2019s completion date, even though this is one of the hardest things \nto do.\nSometimes, there are business constraints that dictate the completion of the \nproject. For example, new legislative requirements may affect the deployment \ndate, such as with the Affordable Care Act deployment date. Of course, it is \nalways risky to assume that setting a target date actually gives the development \nteam sufficient time to complete the project. A window of opportunity may also \nprovide a powerful motivation to complete a project at a specific time. These \nconsiderations should be made manifest and considered in the project approval \nand project planning processes.\nThe major inputs toward estimating the project completion date are the \nscoping document and the amount of effort required to develop the listed \nrequirements. As indicated earlier, it is difficult to make an estimate with any \ndegree of accuracy. At this early point in the project, gross estimates of team \nsize and time frame are usually the best that can be achieved. For a predictive \napproach, the list of requirements can serve as the starting point for estimating \nthe effort required to define and develop a particular function. For an adaptive \napproach, the same information can be used to estimate the number of iterations \nrequired and the size and number of teams working on the various subsystems.\nFigure 11-7 shows an example of a time estimate document for RMO.\nFor RMO, the development of the time estimate was a one-day exercise. \nBecause the project didn\u2019t yet have approval or funding, neither a project man-\nager nor any systems analysts had been assigned to the project. However, a proj-\nect manager had been assigned to obtain approval, and two systems analysts \nwere assigned to help him. These three experienced technical people met for \nfour hours with the key users from the various RMO departments. The object \nof these meetings was to build a comprehensive list of all the functional require-\nments from each department. After the meetings, the group met again to orga-\nnize this list of requirements into groupings that could be assigned to various \niterations for the development of the software.\nTime Estimate for the New CSMS Project \nSubsystem\nFunctional\nrequirements\nIterations\nrequired\n15\nOrder Fulfillment subsystem* \n12\nCustomer Account subsystem** \n10\nMarketing subsystem**\n6\n7\n5\n5\n4\n3\n3\n2\nEstimated \ntime\n20 weeks\n20 weeks\n15 weeks\n13 weeks\n12 weeks\n40 weeks\n8 weeks\n48 weeks\nReporting subsystem** \nTotal development time (2 teams) \nFinal hardening and acceptance testing \nTotal project time\n*Assigned to Tiger team\n**Assigned to Cougar team \nSales subsystem* \nFigure 11-7 Project completion \ndate estimate for the CSMS project\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Other cost elements include the cost of the new computers; training for \nthe users; offices, facilities, and utilities for the project team; travel expenses for \nthe project team to do site visits; and software licenses. As you can see, this esti-\nmate is a little over $1.5 million.\nAfter the system has been put into production, there will be annual oper-\nating costs, as shown in Figure 11-9. The largest cost is for a hosting service \nto provide some of the equipment, the connection to the Internet, and server \nadministration services. These estimated costs were based on RMO using a \nhosting service to provide the equipment, the connection to the Internet, and \nserver administration. The project team estimated about $13,000 a month for \nthose expenses, which is enough for 15 large managed servers. This appeared \nto be more than adequate depending on the traffic volume.

However, the project manager can help \nthe client identify categories of potential benefits. Typical areas of increased rev-\nenue or cost reduction benefits include:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nOpening up new markets with new services, products, or locations\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIncreasing market share in existing markets\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEnhancing cross-sales capabilities with existing customers\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReducing staff by automating manual functions or increasing efficiency\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDecreasing operating expenses, such as shipping charges for \u201cemergency \nshipments\u201d\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReducing error rates through automated editing or validation\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReducing bad accounts or bad credit losses\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReducing inventory or merchandise losses through tighter controls\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCollecting receivables (accounts receivable) more rapidly\nThe project team at RMO worked with the vice president of sales and mar-\nketing to identify benefit areas and estimate a value for each one. This size of \nan investment and ongoing expense was going to require board approval within \nRMO. The board will want to know what the benefits of the new system will be \nand what the return on the investment will be. One of the difficulties for RMO \nis to determine how to assign a value to a benefit. A typical question might be \n\u201cDo we assign the value of all our sales given that this system is needed to stay \ncompetitive in the marketplace? Or do we assign only the value of the increased \nsales we expect to get from marketing and higher volume?\u201d If sales will drop \nbecause RMO becomes less competitive in the marketplace, the total sales value \ncould be used. However, if the existing system is good enough to maintain a \ngood client base, then only the increased sales should be used. These kinds of \ndecisions are made by the client, not the project team. In this case, the vice presi-\ndent of sales and marketing at RMO decided to use a more conservative esti-\nmate. Figure 11-10 summarizes the estimates he generated.\nMany organizations like to compare the estimated costs with the antici-\npated benefits to calculate whether the benefits outweigh the costs. This process \nis called a cost/benefit analysis. Companies use a combination of methods \nto measure the overall benefit of the new system. One popular approach is to \ndetermine the net present value (NPV) of the new system. The two concepts \nbehind net present value are (1) that all benefits and costs are calculated in terms \nof today\u2019s dollars (present value) and (2) that benefits and costs are combined to \ngive a net value. The future stream of benefits and costs are netted together and \nthen discounted by a factor for each year in the future. The discount factor is \nthe rate used to bring future values back to current values.

{"text": "342\nPART 4 \u25a0 System Development and Project Management\nFigure 11-11 shows a copy of the NPV calculation done for RMO\u2019s new \nCSMS. There are various techniques for calculating the NPV of a given invest-\nment. In this example, Year 0 represents the development period prior to the \ndeployment of the system. The annual benefits for each year are extended across \nthe top row. The development costs are shown on the second row. Annual \nexpenses are shown on the third. Those three rows are combined in the fourth \nrow to give the net benefits and costs. The fifth row shows the discount value \ngiven a 6 percent discount rate. The sixth row is the product of the fourth and \nfifth rows and represents the net value in terms of today\u2019s dollars (i.e., the NPV). \nThe seventh row shows a cumulative total of annual NPVs.\nIn Figure 11-11, the numbers in the seventh row eventually change from nega-\ntive to positive. The point in time when that happens is called the break-even \npoint. The length of time before the break-even point is reached is called the pay-\nback period. The payback period occurs in the year that the cumulative value \ngoes positive. To calculate it, first take the last year that the cumulative value is \nnegative\u2014in this case, Year 2. Add to that year the number of days in the follow-\ning year (in this case, Year 3) that it takes for the cumulative value to go positive. \nThe method for doing that is to take absolute values of the ending value in Year \n2 divided by the sum of the absolute values for the end of Year 2 and Year 3\u2014in \nthis case, 226,865 divided by (226,8651430,743). Here, that calculation indicates \nthat the cumulative value goes positive after 35 percent of the year has passed. \nMultiply .35 times the 365 days in the year to get 128 days into Year 3. Many \ncompanies require a payback period of two to three years on new software.\nThe previous cost/benefit calculation depends on an organization\u2019s ability \nto quantify the costs and benefits. If it can indeed estimate a dollar value for a \nbenefit or a cost, the organization treats that value as a tangible benefit or cost. \nHowever, in many instances, an organization can\u2019t measure some of the costs \nand benefits to determine a value. Never discount the importance of ascertaining \nthe \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d reasons for a project. There may be political reasons for \nor against the project that override all other feasibility analyses. If\u00a0there is no reli-\nable method for estimating or measuring the value, it is considered an intangible \nbenefit. In some instances, the importance of the intangible benefits far exceeds \nthe tangible costs\u2014at least in the opinion of the client, who pursues developing \nthe system even though the dollar numbers don\u2019t indicate a good investment.\nExamples of intangible benefits include:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIncreased levels of service (in ways that can\u2019t be measured in dollars)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIncreased customer satisfaction (not measurable in dollars)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSurvival\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nNeed to develop in-house expertise (such as a pilot program with new \ntechnology)\nFigure 11-11 Five-year cost/benefit analysis for CSMS\nbreak-even point\u2003 the point in time at \nwhich dollar benefits offset dollar costs\npayback period\u2003 the time period during \nwhich the dollar benefits offset the dollar \ncosts\ntangible benefit\u2003 a benefit that can be \nmeasured or estimated in terms of dollars\nintangible benefit\u2003 a benefit that accrues \nto an organization but that can\u2019t be measured \nquantitatively or estimated accurately\nSource: Microsoft Corporation\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Because each project is a unique endeavor, every project \nhas unique challenges that affect its potential success.\nThe objective of this activity is to identify and assess the potential risks to \nproject success and to take steps to eliminate or at least ameliorate these risks. \nThey should be identified during the project approval process so all stakehold-\ners are aware of the potential for failure. The team can also establish plans \nand procedures to ensure that those risks don\u2019t interfere with the success of \nthe \u00ad\nproject. Generally, the team assigns itself these tasks when confirming a \n\u00ad\nproject\u2019s feasibility:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDetermine the organizational risks and feasibility.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEvaluate the technological risks and feasibility.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAssess the resource risks and feasibility.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIdentify the schedule risks and feasibility.\n\u275a\n\u275aDetermine Organizational Risks and Feasibility\nEach company has its own culture, and any new system must be accommodated \nto that culture. There is always the risk that a new system departs so dramati-\ncally from existing norms that it can\u2019t be successfully deployed. The analysts \ninvolved with feasibility analysis should evaluate organizational and cultural \nissues to identify potential risks for the new system. Such issues might include:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSubstantial computer phobia\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nA perceived loss of control on the part of staff or management\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPotential shifting of political and organizational power due to the \nnew\u00a0system\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFear of change of job responsibilities\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFear of loss of employment due to increased automation\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReversal of long-standing work procedures\nIt isn\u2019t possible to enumerate all the potential organizational and cultural \nrisks that exist. The project management team needs to be very sensitive to the \nreluctance within the organization to identify and resolve these risks.\nAfter identifying the risks, the project management team can take positive \nsteps to counter them. For example, the team can hold additional training ses-\nsions to teach new procedures and provide increased computer skills. Higher \nlevels of user involvement in developing the new system will tend to increase \nuser enthusiasm and commitment.\n\u275a\n\u275aEvaluate Technological Risks and Feasibility\nGenerally, a new system brings new technology into the company, even state-of-\nthe-art technology. Other projects use existing technology but combine it into \nnew, untested configurations. If an outside vendor is providing a capability in a \ncertain area, the client organization usually assumes the vendor is an expert in \nthat area. However, even an outside vendor may find the requested level of tech-\nnology too complicated.\nThe project management team needs to carefully assess the proposed tech-\nnological requirements and available expertise. When these risks are identified, \nthe solutions are usually straightforward. The solutions to technological risks \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "344\nPART 4 \u25a0 System Development and Project Management\ninclude providing additional training, hiring consultants, or hiring more experi-\nenced employees. In some cases, the scope and approach of the project may need \nto be changed to ameliorate technological risk. The important point is that a \nrealistic assessment will identify technological risks early, making it possible to \nimplement corrective measures.\n\u275a\n\u275aAssess Resource Risks and Feasibility\nThe project management team must also assess the availability of resources for \nthe project. The primary resource consists of team members. Development proj-\nects require the involvement of systems analysts, system technicians, and users. \nRequired people may not be available to the team at the necessary times. An \nadditional risk is that people assigned to the team may not have the necessary \nskills for the project. After the team is functioning, members may have to leave \nthe team. This threat can come either from staff who are transferred within \nthe organization if other special projects arise or from qualified team members \nwho are hired by other organizations. Although the project manager usually \ndoesn\u2019t like to think about these possibilities, skilled people are in short supply \nand sometimes do leave projects.\nThe other resources required for a successful project include adequate com-\nputer resources, physical facilities, and support staff. Generally, these resources \ncan be made available, but the schedule can be affected by delays in the avail-\nability of these resources.\n\u275a\n\u275aIdentify Schedule Risks and Feasibility\nThe development of a project schedule always involves high risk. Every sched-\nule requires many assumptions and estimates without adequate information. For \nexample, the needs (and, hence, the scope) of the new system aren\u2019t well known. \nAlso, the time needed to research and finalize requirements has to be estimated. \nThe availability and capability of team members aren\u2019t completely known.\nAnother frequent risk in developing the schedule occurs when upper man-\nagement decides that the new system must be deployed within a certain time. \nSometimes, there is an important business reason for setting a fixed deadline, \nsuch as RMO\u2019s need to complete the CSS in time for online ordering over the \nholidays. Similarly, universities require the completion of new systems before \nkey dates in the university schedule. For example, if a new admissions system \nisn\u2019t completed before the admissions season, then it might as well wait another \nfull year. In cases like these, schedule feasibility can be the most important fea-\nsibility factor to consider.\nIf the deadline appears arbitrary, the tendency is to create the schedule to \nshow that it can be done. Unfortunately, this practice usually spells disaster. \nThe project team should create the schedule without any preconceived notion \nof required completion dates. After the schedule is completed, comparisons can \nbe done to see whether timetables coincide. If not, the team can take corrective \nmeasures, such as reducing the scope of the project, to increase the probability \nof the project\u2019s on-time completion.\nOne objective of defining milestones and iterations during the project sched-\nule is to permit the project manager to assess the ongoing risk of schedule slip-\npage. If the team begins to miss milestones, the manager can possibly implement \ncorrective measures early. Contingency plans can be developed and carried out \nto reduce the risk of further slippage.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Review with Client and Obtain Approval\nAs mentioned earlier, the amount of expenditure for the RMO project required \nboard approval. However, before a presentation could be given to the board, \nRMO\u2019s executive committee needed to understand and agree to the project. \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The depart-\nments, such as Sales and Marketing, will be directly impacted. They will have \nto allocate staff and resources to help in defining the requirements, develop-\ning test cases, and testing the new system as it is developed. In other words, \nthe people in this department will have extra duties for the next 12 months \nor so. Even departments not directly involved will need to support this heavy \ndevelopment activity, perhaps tightening their budgets. In any event, it is always \ngood policy to get the approval and support of the entire company. This pro-\ncess starts by making presentations to the senior executives of RMO. Often, a \nproject \u00ad\nmanager will be asked to make the presentation or at least be present to \nanswer questions.\nAfter the executive committee approves the project, it goes to the board. \nAfter board approval, the IT Department begins to assign full-time resources \nto the project. It is also a good idea at this point to have a company-wide memo \nor meeting to mark the beginning of this major activity. If the entire company \nknows that all the executives are supporting it and requesting cooperation, the \nproject will proceed much more smoothly.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Activities of Core Process 2: Plan and Monitor the Project\nThis core process lasts throughout the entire project. A major planning effort \noccurs immediately after the project is approved. Ongoing planning and project \nmonitoring continue during all project iterations. Not only must each iteration \nbe planned as it starts, but progress must continually be monitored and correc-\ntive actions may be required. Figure 11-12 illustrates by the height of the effort \ncurve in each iteration that planning and monitoring activities must be an inte-\ngral part of every project iteration.

Others will be decided during the approval \nprocess. In any case, the project manager must ensure that the project\u2019s param-\neters and the work environment are finalized so the work of the project can \nproceed without roadblocks or delays. There are important project structure \nconsiderations that must be addressed as the project gets under way. For exam-\nple, what kind of communication processes will be needed to keep the team and \nexternal stakeholders informed about what is going on? In addition, the mem-\nbers of the project team all need computers and integrated development environ-\nments (IDEs) and other tools to do their work. Of course, specific procedures \nabout how the project team meets with the users, how they write code, and how \nthey submit code for acceptance also need to be finalized. The following sec-\ntions discuss three important considerations:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nRecording and communicating\u2014internal/external\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWork environment\u2014support/facilities/tools\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nProcesses and procedures\n\u275a\n\u275aRecording and Communicating\u2014Internal/External\nThe project manager and project team members will be involved in all types of \nmeetings where decisions will be made and information developed. Determining \nwhat is important and how to record this information need to be set out in spe-\ncific project procedures. The other critical issue with information is what, how, \nhow frequently, and to whom this information needs to be disseminated. One of \nthe first tasks for a project manager on a new project is to establish the proce-\ndures and guidelines for how to handle the project\u2019s information.\nA critical success factor for IT projects is to have the support of the organi-\nzation\u2019s executives and other key stakeholders. A good project manager under-\nstands this need and structures his or her project so he or she communicates \nfrequently, with the appropriate detail, to each of his or her stakeholders. Figure \n11-2 identified the various stakeholders and participants in a project. Some of \nthese stakeholders will be integrally involved with the project. Other stakehold-\ners will be only marginally involved, receiving periodic status reports. The client \nstakeholders (the ones paying the project costs) will need to be kept aware of \nthe project\u2019s status and of any difficulties or delays. A stakeholder analysis helps \nidentify all those persons who have an interest in the project and defines what \ninformation they will want and need concerning the project. Generally, we refer \nto this as external reporting of project information.\nMaintaining project information can be done via electronic means. Spread-\nsheets, e-mails, newsletters, and list servers all provide ways to maintain, col-\nlect, and distribute information. Once the electronic systems are set up, they will \noften take care of themselves. Project information can be published to a Web site \nso everyone can view it.\nAnother type of project-tracking tool, sometimes called a project \u00ad\ndashboard, \nallows all types of project information to be posted and viewed by Web brows-\ners. There are many available application systems that will extract the project \ndata and illustrate it in different formats. Many of these systems are flexible and \nallow the project manager to configure the data as well as the look and feel of \nthe project dashboard. Figure 11-13 is an example of a project dashboard sys-\ntem that allows easy access to project information. Each of the tiles on the dash-\nboard is a hot link and will open up a new window with more details, charts, \nand graphs.\nThe members of the project team also need to have mechanisms in place \nto communicate among themselves and document project decisions. This is an \nentirely different type of information\u2014information about the system under \ndevelopment. For example, during analysis activities, the project team docu-\nments the results of user meetings by using various means, such as writing use \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The data \u00ad\nrepository \nin the figure usually consists of many different types of data structures and \n\u00ad\nstorage techniques\u2014from wikis to databases to issue-tracking systems.\nThere is one caveat related to recording and communicating. With tradi-\ntional predictive projects, the tendency was to create reams and reams of docu-\nmentation. As you learned in the previous chapter, adaptive projects that use the \nAgile philosophy emphasize code over documentation. A novice project man-\nager may interpret that to mean that no documentation is required. However, \neven with an Agile approach, the basic user definitions need to be documented \nfor later verification. It isn\u2019t uncommon during programming for a programmer \nto have to refer back to notes and models to remember the exact details and \ndecisions of a particular requirement. An experienced project manager knows \nthe right amount of documentation so the project isn\u2019t overloaded with overhead \nbut that critical decisions are recorded.\nIt should be obvious that a comprehensive recording and communica-\ntion scheme needs to be put in place. Fortunately, in today\u2019s connected world, \nthere are many tools available so external and internal communication can \nbe done\u00a0easily. With so many electronic tools, all project information should \nbe\u00a0available online and accessible to all stakeholders. In fact, with the use of \nwikis, it is now common to allow many team members and even users to assist \nin the recording and updating of critical project information.\nThe CSMS team wanted to maintain its project information in digital for-\nmat and have it available to all stakeholders, including team members, users, \nthe client, and the members of the steering committee.

Barbara Halifax, the project manager, wanted to ensure the tools \nwere in place so it was easy to record information when it was prudent to do so.\nUser documents, such as sample invoices, were scanned and placed in a doc-\nument repository. User functional definitions were recorded in a forum system. \nUsing a forum allowed team members and users to update it when key issues \nwere discussed and needed to be remembered. Sample screen and report layouts \nwere either sketched out or drawn with Visio or Keynote. Hand sketches were \noften scanned and saved. Most design decisions and specifications went right \ninto the program code and weren\u2019t documented. However, some decisions were \nglobal, and those were captured in a wiki.\nEach day, the project team had a \u201cstand up\u201d meeting\u2014a short coordina-\ntion meeting. Most of the team members were in the Park City Center, but some \nusers were assigned to the team from other locations. Sometimes, team members \nwere visiting user sites and therefore not available, and there were some team \nmembers who worked in the Salt Lake City office. Therefore, the daily meeting \nwas conducted as a videoconference call using Skype, with each person using \nhis or her webcam and personal computer. The meeting normally lasted about \n15\u00a0minutes.\nFinally, there was some discussion of sending out a biweekly newsletter \nabout the progress on the project. Barbara felt that it was important for the \nentire company to stay informed about the project to encourage their enthusi-\nasm and support.

There are five major components of the work \nenvironment:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPersonal computer(s) and/or workstation(s)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPersonal development software and tools\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDevelopment server with repositories, sandboxes, and communication tools\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nOffice space, conference rooms, and equipment, including printers, scanners, \nand projectors\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSupport staff\nMost important, of course, is the computer equipment and other hardware \nthat the team will need. Obviously, each developer will need his or her own \ncomputing configuration, which may consist of multiple computers or monitors. \nOther important hardware includes the development servers, printers, and inter-\nnal development network. If the team is distributed, video cameras and projec-\ntors may be necessary to conduct distributed team meetings. Along with the \nhardware, resources must be made available to administer things such as the \ndevelopment server.\nRelated to the hardware is the computer software and other tools. Software \ntools can get quite elaborate\u2014from stand-alone IDE tools to modeling software \nto code repository software. The development server, with its environment and \nsoftware, must also be configured and deployed. The server may be set up as a vir-\ntual server or as a stand-alone computer. Applications include such things as code \nrepository, issue-tracking application, testing system, and the project dashboard.\nAlong with the hardware and software, a work configuration must be pro-\nvided for each developer, with logon permissions, sandbox environments, repos-\nitory access, and so forth. The final two components are the office space and \nother facilities that may be needed. This will include access to conference rooms, \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Earlier, you learned about a project\u2019s level of formality. Larger \nprojects require more elaborate reporting processes and meeting schedules. \nWhen there are many people involved, coordination of activities becomes \n\u00ad\ncritical. Procedures include:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReporting and documentation\u2014What is done? How is it done? Who does it?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nProgramming\u2014Single or pair programming? How is work assigned?

How are they accepted?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCode and version control\u2014How is the code controlled to prevent conflicts? \nHow do you coordinate bug fixing with new development? How and when \nare deliverables released?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Schedule the Work\nScheduling the work is necessary for any size or type of project. However, the \ntechniques used can vary widely depending on the type of project. For predic-\ntive, highly controlled projects, a detailed and complete schedule that covers \nthe entire project is usually built. Again, these kinds of schedules only work \nbecause the software to be built is well understood. However, even in those proj-\nects with detailed and comprehensive schedules, accommodation is required as \nthings change during the life of the project. At the other end of the spectrum, \nsmall Agile projects sometimes don\u2019t even have a project schedule, with the team \nmembers being responsible for scheduling their own work. Coordination is \naccomplished by talking and keeping each other informed of what each person \nis working on. This is what is meant by chaordic.\nScheduling the work for many of today\u2019s projects lies somewhere between \nthese two extremes. Large projects may have several independent teams of \ndevelopers working on various subsystems. Even though the work between the \nteams is fairly independent, coordination is still required. Adaptive projects also \nanticipate additional requests and changes to the original scheduled tasks.\nFor adaptive types of projects, creating the project schedule is done through-\nout the life of the project. During the initial planning phase, the initial list of use \ncases or user stores is developed for each subsystem. The use cases are divided up \nand tentatively assigned to the iterations. Let us call this the project \u00ad\niteration \nschedule. As each iteration is begun, a detailed schedule of tasks and work to \nbe done is developed. You saw an example of creating an iteration schedule in \nChapter 1. Let us call this schedule a detailed work schedule, meaning that it \nschedules the work within an iteration. Sometime during each iteration\u2014often \nas one iteration is finishing and before the next iteration begins\u2014the project \nmanager, with assistance from the team leaders and key users, will review and \nrework the project iteration schedule. During this process, the changes and any \nnew requirements are prioritized and placed on the schedule.\nCreating the project iteration schedule must take into account the total size \nand configuration of the solution system and the number of teams available to \nwork on the project. Separate lists of requirements are made by each subsystem, \nproject iteration schedule\u2003 the list of \n\u00ad\niterations and use cases or user stories \nassigned to each iteration\ndetailed work schedule\u2003 the schedule \nthat lists, organizes, and describes the depen-\ndencies of the detailed work tasks\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Some tasks, \nsuch as designing the database, may go across all subsystems and need to be \nscheduled separately or be included in every subsystem list. Figure 11-16 shows a \nsample project iteration schedule for the CSMS Sales subsystem. As you can see, \nthe length of each iteration is fairly constant at around four weeks. All the iden-\ntified tasks, which represent the requirements, have been assigned to iterations. \nIn\u00a0this case, we have identified five iterations.\nDeveloping a detailed work schedule for a single iteration is a three-step \nprocess:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDevelop a work breakdown structure.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEstimate effort and identify dependencies.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCreate a schedule by using a Gantt chart.\nA work breakdown structure (WBS) is a list of all the required individual \nactivities and tasks for the project. There are two general approaches for creat-\ning a WBS: by deliverable or by a timeline. The first approach identifies all the \ndeliverables that must be completed for a given iteration. Then, the WBS identi-\nfies every task that is necessary to create each deliverable. The second approach \nworks through the normal sequence of activities that are required for the final \ndeliverable. Experienced developers who have worked on Agile projects under-\nstand the steps and tasks that are required to create a particular deliverable. \nOf\u00a0course, each iteration is slightly different depending on the particular func-\ntions and deliverables that are included.\nFigure 11-17 is a sample handwritten WBS for the first iteration of the Sales \nsubsystem. The tasks have been partitioned according to the core processes \nPlanning, Analysis, Design, and Building. In the figure, each task also has an \nestimate of the time required. Sometimes, two estimates are provided: the effort \nrequired and the expected duration. The effort required is given in person-days \nof work, and the duration is a measure of lapsed calendar time. Of course, these \nare related depending on the number of people working on the specific task. \nIn Figure 11-16, only duration is shown; however, the time estimates assume a \nproject team of four people.\nIteration\nTime estimate\nProject Iteration Schedule for the CSMS Sales Subsystem\nUse cases assigned to iteration \n1\n2\n4 weeks\n4 weeks\n3\n5 weeks\n5.

{"text": "352\nPART 4 \u25a0 System Development and Project Management\nWhen developing a WBS, new analysts frequently ask, \u201cHow detailed \nshould the individual tasks be?\u201d A few guidelines can help answer that question:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nThere should be a way to recognize when the task is complete.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nThe definition of the task should be clear enough so you can estimate the \namount of effort required.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAs a general rule for software projects, the effort should take one to five \nworking days.\nThe second step in developing a detailed work schedule for a single iteration \nis to determine the dependencies between the tasks and the amount of effort \nrequired for each. The most common way to relate tasks is to consider the order \nin which they are completed; for example, as one task finishes, the next one \nstarts. This is called a finish-start relationship. Other ways to relate tasks include \nstart-start relationships, in which tasks start at the same time, and finish-finish \nFigure 11-17 Work breakdown \nstructure for first iteration\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The effort required \nshould be the actual amount of work required to complete the task. As\u00a0with the \nidentification of the tasks in the WBS, the dependencies and effort estimates \nshould be done by the developers who are going to actually do the work.\nThe third step in developing a detailed work schedule is to actually cre-\nate the iteration schedule. In Chapter 1, Figure 1-10 presented a graph of the \ntasks involved in the first iteration of the Tradeshow System, their sequence, \nand the estimated calendar time to complete them. The graph was, in actual-\nity, a simplified PERT/CPM chart. Online Chapter C provides more informa-\ntion about PERT charts. The other form for presenting a schedule is a bar chart \nthat shows the activities as bars on a horizontal timeline; this is called a Gantt \nchart. A\u00a0widely used tool for building Gantt charts is Microsoft Project. New \nversions of Microsoft Project are network enabled and provide a powerful tool \nto not only create schedules, but to also distribute schedule information across \nthe organization by using HTML and the HTTP protocol so it can be viewed \nin a browser. The benefit of using a tool such as Microsoft Project is that the \nproject manager can update progress easily and make that information widely \navailable. Online Chapter C provides more detailed instructions both on Gantt \ncharts and on the Microsoft Project management software.\nFigure 11-18 shows an iteration schedule from the RMO CSMS project \nformatted as a bar chart. In the figure, the tasks from the work breakdown \nstructure are listed in the Task Name column and the durations are listed in \nthe Duration column. The Predecessor column identifies dependencies between \ntasks. As you can see, every task except the first has at least one predecessor task, \nand every task except the last is a predecessor to one or more other tasks. There \nare various ways to document dependencies. The most common way is to show \nthe finish of one task occurring before the start of another (FS). Other common \nways are finish-finish (FF), where both must finish at the same time, and start-\nstart (SS), where both must start at the same time. Any dependency can have a \nlag time, such as that shown on Line 11 of Figure 11-18. The final column docu-\nments what resources have been assigned to each task. In this example, the Tiger \nTeam is divided into two subteams of two people each: TT1 and TT2.\nGantt chart\u2003 a bar chart that portrays the \nschedule by the length of horizontal bars \nsuperimposed on a calendar\nFigure 11-18 An iteration schedule for the first iteration of the Shopping Cart subsystem\nSource: Microsoft Corporation\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "354\nPART 4 \u25a0 System Development and Project Management\nThe bars in Figure 11-18 illustrate the duration of each task superimposed on \na calendar. The red bars indicate a critical path on the schedule. The critical path \nis defined as those tasks that must stay on schedule. If any of the critical path tasks \ncause a schedule slip, then the entire project is delayed. The blue bars are those \ntasks that aren\u2019t on the critical path. Obviously, a project manager will monitor \ncritical path tasks quite closely. Online Chapter C gives more detailed explanations \nand instructions on how to use Microsoft Project to create Gantt chart schedules.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Staff and Allocate Resources\nIn an Agile project, the various teams are self-organizing. They decide how they \nare going to work together and assign the tasks to be done among themselves. \nHowever, the job of identifying what expertise is needed for the project and \ngetting those people assigned to the project falls on the shoulders of the project \nmanager. This includes finding the right people with the correct skills and then \norganizing and managing them throughout the project. The staffing activity \nconsists of five tasks:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDeveloping a resource plan for the project\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIdentifying and requesting specific technical staff\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIdentifying and requesting specific user staff\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nOrganizing the project team into work groups\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nConducting preliminary training and team-building exercises\nBased on the tasks identified in the project schedule, the project manager \ncan develop a detailed resource plan. In fact, the schedule and the resource \nrequirements are usually developed concurrently. In developing the plan, the \nproject manager recognizes that (1) resources usually aren\u2019t available as soon as \nrequested and (2) a period of time is needed for a person to become acquainted \nwith the project. After developing the plan, the project manager can then iden-\ntify specific people and request that they become part of the team.\nOn small projects, members of the project team may all work together. \n\u00ad\nHowever, a project team that is larger than four or five members is usually \ndivided into smaller work groups. Each group will have a group leader who \ncoordinates the tasks assigned to the group. The project manager is responsible \nfor dividing the team into groups and assigning group leaders.\nFinally, training and team-building exercises are conducted. Training may \nbe done for the project team as a whole when such new technology as a new \ndatabase or a new programming language is used. In other cases, team members \nwho are unfamiliar with the tools and techniques being used may require indi-\nvidual training. The team should conduct appropriate training for technical peo-\nple and users. Team-building exercises are especially important when members \nhaven\u2019t worked together before. The integration of users with technical people is \nan important consideration in developing effective teams and workgroups.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Evaluate Work Processes (How Are We Doing?)\nAlthough evaluating how the project team performed is sometimes done on pre-\ndictive projects, it isn\u2019t a common practice. However, on iterative projects, many \ncompanies require an \u201cend of iteration\u201d review of how well the team performed \nand worked together. One of the advantages of an iterative project is that the same \nteam often stays together for a number of iterations. After each iteration, team \nmembers can evaluate how well they worked together and how they can improve \ntheir effectiveness and performance as a team. In an Agile project, this is referred \nto as a retrospective. Here are the kinds of questions the team might want to ask:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAre our communication procedures adequate? How can they be improved?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAre our working relationships with the user effective?\nretrospective\u2003 a meeting held by the team \nat the end of an iteration to determine what \nwas successful and what can be improved\ncritical path\u2003 a sequence of tasks that \ncan\u2019t be delayed without causing the entire \nproject to be delayed\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

How can we eliminate them?\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Monitor Project Progress and Make Corrections\nIn theory, executing and controlling the project plan sounds easy, but in fact, \nit is quite complicated. To execute any project, you need some type of project \nplan. How a team builds and executes project plans will vary depending on \nwhether the project structure is based on a predictive approach or an adaptive \napproach. In the predictive approach, the project plans are quite large and com-\nplex. The\u00a0adaptive approach is less daunting because the detailed project plan \nis done for each iteration. Because the piece of work is smaller and often better \nunderstood, these plans tend to be smaller and less complex.\nFigure 11-19 is a high-level process chart that illustrates the basic process \nfor monitoring and controlling the project. The first box\u2014Assign work to per-\nson or team\u2014refers to a task that is complex all by itself due to the fact that \nteams are made up of people with varying skill levels and experiences.\nThe task for the second box\u2014Collect status\u2014is less complex. When col-\nlecting status information, you should adhere to the certain guidelines. First, \nproviding status information should be a standard process for all team mem-\nbers. Second, status information should be collected and posted electronically \nfor all to see. Status information can be reported at milestones as complete or \nnot complete.\nThe task for the third box\u2014Analyze variance\u2014requires the project man-\nager to try to determine why the task isn\u2019t on target and how significant the \ndelay is with regard to the impact on the total project.\nThe task for the fourth box\u2014Take corrective action\u2014can be complex. \n\u00ad\nExperienced project managers have a whole set of tools they can use to try to \ncorrect the variance. Sometimes, the correction is as simple as reassigning team \nmembers or maybe it just requires some extra hours of overtime. At other times, \ntasks may have to be rearranged. In more serious instances, the entire schedule \nmay have to be reworked or more team members may need to be recruited for the \nteam. The objective of corrective action is to get the project back to a known and \npredictable schedule.\nEvery development project\u2014whether it follows a predictive or adaptive \napproach\u2014has lots of questions that need answers and many decisions that need \nto be made. In many cases, these issues are quickly resolved and the project \nmoves rapidly forward. However, in other instances, the answer to a question \nor the resolution of an open issue will require additional research. For example, \nTake corrective\naction\nIs variance\nsignificant?\nAssign work to\nperson or team\nCollect status\nIs task\ncomplete?\nIs task on\ntarget?\nAnalyze\nvariance\nyes\nno\nno\nno\nyes\nyes\nFigure 11-19 Process to monitor and control project execution\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

If management is still making \ndecisions about these rules, you will need to track these issues until they are \nresolved.\nThe monitoring and control of open issues and risks for a project is usually \nno more complex than building various tracking logs. These logs can be built in \na simple spreadsheet and posted on the project\u2019s Web site or central repository. \nIt is a good idea to make these logs available to all team members.

It covered three major themes: (1) the \nprinciples of project management, (2) the activities to \nget a project initiated and approved, and (3) the activi-\nties to plan the project and monitor its progress.\nProject management is the organizing and direct-\ning of other people to achieve a planned result. Histori-\ncally, software projects haven\u2019t had a very good track \nrecord. Strong project management is seen as one fac-\ntor that improves success rates of software development \nprojects. Other factors, such as the adaptive approach \nto the SDLC, can also contribute to project success.\nIn this chapter\u2019s first section, many important \nskills, techniques, and concepts that relate to project \nmanagement were discussed. The project management \nbody of knowledge (PMBOK) provides an extensive \nconceptual foundation for learning about project man-\nagement. Agile project management also requires the \nsame foundation concepts and skills as the PMBOK, \nalthough many of the specific techniques may be \ndifferent.\nThis chapter\u2019s second major section focused on the \nspecific activities of Core Process 1, the objective of \nwhich is to identify the business need and to get the \nproject initiated. These activities include:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIdentifying the problem\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nExtending the project approval factors\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPerforming risk and feasibility analysis\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReviewing with the client and obtaining approval\nThis chapter\u2019s third major section focused on those \nactivities that are necessary to get the project planned, \nscheduled, and started.

As Monica Gibbons, an assistant vice president of \ninformation systems, prepared for the interview, she re-\nviewed Stewart\u2019s assignments over the last year and his \nperformance. Stewart was one of the \u201cup and coming\u201d \nsystems analysts in the company, and she wanted to be \nsure to give him solid advice on how to advance his ca-\nreer. For example, she knew that he had a strong desire to \nbecome a project manager and accept increasing levels of \nresponsibility. His desire was certainly in agreement with \nthe needs of the company.\nCustom Load Trucking (CLT) is a nationwide trucking firm \nthat specializes in the movement of high-tech equipment. \nWith the rapid growth of the communications and computer \nindustries, CLT was feeling more and more pressure from its \nclients to move its loads more rapidly and precisely. Several \nnew information systems were planned that would enable \nCLT to schedule and track shipments and truck locations al-\nmost to the minute. However, trucking wasn\u2019t necessarily a \nhigh-interest industry for information systems experts. With \nthe shortage in the job market, CLT had decided not to try \nto hire project managers for these new projects but to build \nstrong project managers from within the organization.\nAs Monica reviewed Stewart\u2019s record, she found that he \nhad done an excellent job as a team leader on his last project, \nwhere he was a combination team leader and systems \n \nanalyst on a four-person team. He had been involved in \nsystems analysis, design, and programming, and he had \nalso managed the work of the other three team members. \nHe had assisted in the development of the project sched-\nule and had been able to keep his team right on schedule. \nIt also appeared that the quality of his team\u2019s work was \nas good as, if not better than, other teams on the project. \nMonica wondered what advice she should give him to help \nhim advance his career. She was also wondering if now \nwas the time to give him his own project.\n1.\t\nDo you think the decision by CLT to build project man-\nagers from its existing employee base is a good one? \nWhat advice would you give CLT to make sure it has \nstrong project management skills in the company?\n2.\t\nWhat kind of criteria would you develop for Monica to \nuse to measure whether Stewart (or any other poten-\ntial project manager) is ready for project management \nresponsibility?\n3.\t\nHow would you structure the job for new project man-\nagers to ensure or at least increase the possibility of a \nhigh level of success?\n4.\t\nIf you were Monica, what kind of advice would you \ngive Stewart about managing his career and attaining \nhis immediate goal of becoming a project manager?\nCASE STUDY\nCommunity Board of Realtors\u00ae\nThe Board of Realtors Multiple Listing Service (MLS) \nsystem is a fairly focused system. In Chapter 3, you \nidentified a use case diagram for the customer users. \nIn Chapter 8, you extended the functions to include \naspects of the system that would be required for the \nreal estate agents to enter their information. You \nalso made some preliminary estimates of iterations \nand time to complete. Let us expand and refine those \nanswers to include concepts from this chapter.\n\t\n1.\tGiven the total vision of this system, develop a \nSystem Vision Document.

You \nhave been told that four programmers will be available \nto work on this project and that it will have the high-\nest priority within the company. In other words, the \ncompany would like to have this application up and \nrunning as soon as possible. The travel season is fast \napproaching, and Spring Breaks would like to be able \nto use the system for this very next season.\nAs part of the approval and planning activities, \nyou decide that the most important items to develop \nwill be a System Vision Document and a project itera-\ntion plan. Given those elements, you can make an esti-\nmate of the completion date and the development cost \nfor the system.\n\t\n1.\tBased on the answers you gave to the Chapter 2 \nrunning case questions, develop a System Vision \nDocument.\n\t\n2.\tBased on the functional descriptions you pro-\nvided for the Chapter 2 running case and the \nuse cases you defined in Chapter 3, finish iden-\ntifying a complete list of use cases for each of \nthe four subsystems. One important decision \nyou will have to make is which subsystems to \ndevelop first. In other words, can the subsystems \nbe deployed independently and, if so, which \nshould be deployed first? Defend your answer.\n\t\n3.\tA related decision is whether to organize your \nprogrammers into one larger team or multiple \nsmaller teams and how many programmers you \ncan use on this project. Make that decision and \nthen defend your answer.\n\t\n4.\tOnce those decisions are made, develop a project \niteration plan. If you have multiple independent \nteams, your project iteration plan will have par-\nallel paths.\n\t\n5.\tBased on your previous answers, develop an \nestimate for the total project cost and the time \nrequired to complete the project.\n\t\n6.\tAssuming an annual revenue increase of \n$250,000 per year (benefit) and an annual oper-\nating cost of $75,000, develop a five-year NPV \nworksheet by using your estimates for develop-\ning the system. Use a 6 percent discount factor.\nOn the Spot Courier Services\nThis chapter discussed the first two core processes of \na system development project and the activities within \nthese core processes. Obviously, for a normal project, \nthese first two core processes are done at the begin-\nning, when the project manager is still learning about \nthe needs of the business and trying to develop a vision \nof the solution. However, in this case, you have already \ngathered a lot of information about On the Spot from \nthe previous chapters. Use this information to develop \nsome project management planning documents.\nIn Chapter 2, you developed a list of use cases. In \nChapter 8, you identified four required subsystems in \nthe total solution. Chapter 6 provided a good review of \nthe essential system capabilities. Using the discussions of \nOn the Spot from these chapters and the items you have \nproduced from your previous work, produce these items:\n\t\n1.\tCreate a System Vision Document.\n\t\n2.\tReview all the use cases that you identified in \nChapter 2 and then enhance the list to achieve \na complete solution based on the narratives \nthat you have read in previous chapters. In \n\u00ad\nChapter\u00a05, you learned how to do a CRUD \nanalysis. A CRUD analysis of this case indicates \nthat it might be necessary to add a new subsys-\ntem called \u201cAdministration.\u201d Assign use cases to \nthe five subsystems; include the Administration \nsubsystem plus the other four subsystems you \npreviously defined:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCustomer account subsystem (like customer \naccount)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPickup request subsystem (like sales)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPackage delivery subsystem (like order \nfulfillment)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nRouting and scheduling subsystem\n\t\n3.\tCreate a project iteration schedule for each sub-\nsystem.

{"text": "366\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nOpening case\u2002 New Capital Bank: Part 1\nBill Santora, the project leader responsible for devel-\noping an integrated customer account system at New \nCapital Bank, just met with the review committee and \nfinished a technical review of the new system\u2019s first-cut \ndesign. This first-cut design focused on four fundamen-\ntal core use cases and would be implemented in the first \ndevelopment iteration.\nNew Capital Bank had been using object-oriented \ntechniques for quite a while, but it had been slower to \nadopt some of the newer Agile approaches. Bill had \nbeen involved in some pilot projects that had used Uni-\nfied Modeling Language (UML) to develop systems \nusing object-oriented techniques. However, this devel-\nopment project was his first large-scale project that \nwould be entirely Agile.\nAs Bill was collecting his presentation materials, his \nsupervisor, Mary Garcia, spoke to him: \u201cYour technical \nreview went very well, Bill,\u201d she said. \u201cThe committee \nfound only a few minor items that need to be fixed. And \neven though I am not completely current on the new \napproach, it was easy for me to understand how these \ncore functions will work. I still find it hard to believe that \nyou will have these four pieces implemented in the next \nfew weeks though.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Bill said, laughing. \u201cIt won\u2019t \nbe ready for the users then. Getting these four core \nfunctions coded and running doesn\u2019t mean that we \nare almost done. This project will still take a year to \ncomplete.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Mary said. \u201cBut it is nice that we will \nhave something to show after only one month. Not only \ndo I feel more confident in this project, but the users \nlove to see things developing.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bill said. \u201cRemember how much grief \nI got when I originally laid out this plan based on an \niterative approach? It was difficult to detail the project \nschedule for the later iterations, so I had a hard time \nconvincing everybody that the project schedule wasn\u2019t \ntoo risky. The upside is that because each iteration is \nonly four weeks long, we have something to show right \nat the beginning. You don\u2019t know how relieved I am that \nthe design passed the review! The team has done a \nlot of work to make sure the design is solid, and we all \nfelt\u00a0confident.\u201d\n\u201cWell, building it incrementally makes a lot of sense \nand certainly seems to be working,\u201d Mary said. \u201cI espe-\ncially liked the diagrams you showed. It was terrific how \nthe three-layer architectural design supported each use \ncase. Even though I don\u2019t consider myself an advanced \nobject-oriented technician, I could understand how the \nobject-oriented design fit into the architecture. I think \nyou wowed everybody when you demonstrated how \nyou could use the same basic design to support both \nour internal bank tellers and a Web portal for our cus-\ntomers. Congratulations.\u201d\nBill picked up on Mary\u2019s enthusiasm.\n\u201cHow about the design class diagrams?\u201d he asked. \n\u201cDon\u2019t they give a nice overview of the classes and the \nmethods? We use them extensively as a focus for dis-\ncussion on the team. They really help the programmers \nwrite good, solid code.\u201d\nMary nodded in agreement and added, \u201cBy the \nway, have you scheduled a review with the users?\u201d \nMary asked.\n\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d Bill replied. \u201cThe architectural design is \nmostly technical stuff, and we aren\u2019t quite ready to meet \nwith the users. The users will help us by verifying our \nunderstanding of the information availability, but much of \nwhat we do now is too technical for them to\u00a0follow.\u201d\n\u201cI am excited to see the first pieces run,\u201d Mary said. \n\u201cIt just makes so much sense to be able to test these \ncore functions during the rest of the project. Let me \ncongratulate you again.\u201d Then, they headed off to lunch \ntogether.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Overview\nIn Chapters 3, 4, and 5, you learned how to do object-oriented analysis by devel-\noping functional requirements models. You learned that analysis consists of two \nparts: discovery and understanding. Discovery is learning exactly how the user \nconducts his activities through probing questions that provide detailed informa-\ntion. Understanding is taking the information gleaned from user interviews and \nconstructing a set of interrelated and comprehensive models. Model building is \nan essential part of understanding the user needs and how they influence the \nproposed system. However, the objective of analysis models isn\u2019t to describe the \nnew system, but to understand, in precise terms, the requirements.\nIn Chapters 6 and 7, you learned about the need and importance of tech-\nnology architecture and application software architecture.

You will learn how \nto develop object-oriented design models based on the requirements models, \nwhich are then used by the programmers to code the system. This chapter first \nexplains design class diagrams, which are an extension of the problem domain \nclass diagram with design information added.

Throughout this chapter and the next, you learn not only \nthe basics of object-oriented design but also the teaching principles underlying it, \nso the systems you build are well structured and maintainable. These design prin-\nciples will provide you with a solid foundation for designing systems correctly.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Object-Oriented Design: Bridging from \nAnalysis\u00a0to Implementation\nSo, what is object-oriented design? It is a process by which a set of detailed \nobject-oriented design models are built, which are then used by the program-\nmers to write and test programs for the new system. Systems design is the bridge \nbetween user requirements and programming the new system. One strength of \nthe object-oriented approach is that the design models are often just extensions \nof the requirements models. Obviously, it is much easier to extend an existing \nmodel than to create entirely new design models. Frequently, developers like to \nskip the design model step; however, it is a good practice to create design models \nand not just jump into coding. Just as a builder doesn\u2019t build something larger \nthan a doghouse or a shed without a set of blueprints, a good system developer \nwould never try to develop a large system without a set of design models.\nOne tenet of Agile, adaptive development approaches emphasized through-\nout this text is to create models only if they have meaning and are necessary. \nSometimes, new developers misinterpret this guideline to mean that they don\u2019t \nneed to develop design models at all. The design models may not be formal-\nized into a comprehensive set of documents and diagrams, but they are certainly \nnecessary. Developing a system without doing design is comparable to writing \na research paper without an outline. You could just sit down and start writing; \nhowever, if you want a paper that is cohesive, complete, and comprehensive, \nyou should write an outline first. You could write a complex paper without an \noutline, but in all probability, it would be disjointed, hard to follow, and miss-\ning important points\u2014and it would earn a low grade! The outline can be jot-\nted down on paper, but the process of thinking it through and writing it down \nallows the writer to ensure that it is cohesive. Systems design provides the same \ntype of framework.\nThere are three subheadings in this section. First, you\u2019ll review how an \nobject-oriented application works. Second, you\u2019ll identify the analysis models \nthat are used for object-oriented design and indicate how they flow into the \ndesign models. Third, you\u2019ll learn about the design models that support the pro-\ngrammers. In other words, the following sections discuss the design models used \nfor programming.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Overview of Object-Oriented Programs\nLet\u2019s quickly review how an object-oriented program works. Many of you will \nbe familiar with these ideas from your programming classes.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

{"text": "368\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nAn object-oriented program consists of sets of computing objects. Each \nobject has data and program logic encapsulated within itself. Analysts define \nthe structure of the program logic and data fields by defining a class. The class \ndefinition describes the structure or a template of what an executing object \nlooks like. The object itself doesn\u2019t come into existence until the program begins \nto execute. This is called an instantiation of the class\u2014that is, making an \ninstance (an object) based on the template provided by the class definition.\nAn object-oriented program consists of a set of these instantiated objects \nthat cooperate to accomplish a result. These objects work together by sending \neach other messages and working in concert to support the functions of the \nmain program.\nFigure 12-1 depicts how an object-oriented program works. The program \nincludes a window object that displays a form in which to enter a student ID and \nother information (message 1). From the user perspective, this object appears as \na form on a screen. After the student ID is entered, the Window object sends a \nmessage (message 2) to the Student class to tell it to create a new Student object \n(instance) in the program. The new Student object will know that it needs more \ndata for some of its attributes based on internal logic in the student class, so it \nwill send a message to a Database Access object asking for data from the data-\nbase (message 3). Once it is completely instantiated with all the required data, \nthe Student object sends the information back to the Window object to display \nit on the screen. The student user then enters the updates to her personal infor-\nmation (message 4), and another sequence of messages is sent to update the Stu-\ndent object in the program, which forwards information to the Database Access \nobject and writes it to the database.\nThe important concept you should understand is that an object-oriented \nprogram consists of many objects. Within each object, the program logic exists \nFigure 12-1 Object-oriented \nevent-driven program flow\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\ninstantiation\u2003 creation of an object \nbased on the template provided by the \nclass\u00a0definition\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "369\nCHAPTER 12 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Fundamentals\nin small segments called methods. These methods are \u201ccalled\u201d or invoked \nthrough messages. In the example in Figure 12-1, there are three objects, \neach of which has a unique job to do. These three objects can relate back to \n\u00ad\nconcepts you learned in Chapter 7 about three-layer architecture. Referring \nback to \u00ad\nFigure\u00a07-11, \u201cThree-layer architecture,\u201d the three-layers translate to the \nthree objects in Figure 12-1: the Window object (view layer), the Student object \n(domain layer), and the Database Access object (data layer).\nYou can look inside a class and see the program code that corresponds to \nthe functions performed by the objects once they are instantiated. Figure 12-2 \nillustrates an example of the program code for a class with its parameters and \nmethods. Part (a) is the code for Java, and part (b) is the code for VB.NET. The \nmethods, such as getFullName ( ), are the pieces of executable code that carry \nout the functions of the class.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Analysis Models to Design Models\nAs you remember, during analysis two types of information are captured, which \nare used to define the requirements: information about things and informa-\ntion about the business processes. A domain model class diagram described the \ninformation about things, and use case descriptions, activity diagrams, and sys-\ntem sequence diagrams described the information about the business processes. \nIn other words, requirements are documented as domain classes and business \nprocesses.\nTo write a computer program, a programmer needs to know what the \nclasses are, and what the methods are in those classes. If you think through \nFigure 12-1 again, note that the example covers a single use case, perhaps one \ncalled Update student information. This is an important programming concept! \nA programmer will work on one use case at a time. She will select a use case and \nprogram the appropriate methods in the required classes to carry out that use \ncase. Hence, the design models must support that activity. In other words, the \ndesign models must provide the information required to (1) identify the classes \nand (2) document the flow of execution\u2014both for a single use case.\nFigure 12-3 illustrates how this model building process flows from analy-\nsis to design to implementation. Again, note the two types of information\u2014\u00ad\ninformation about things, and information about the flow or the process. The \nanalysis flow models document the flow of the business process, while the design \nflow models document the flow of execution through the classes.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Introduction to the Design Models\nThe primary model used to document the classes and the methods is the design \nclass diagram. The design class diagram is an extension of the domain model \nclass diagram that was developed during analysis activities and requirements \ndefinition. Figure 12-4 illustrates a Student class both as the domain class and \nas the design class. The primary difference is the addition of the method sig-\nnatures for the class. A method signature includes the method name, the input \nparameters, and the type for the returned value. Notice that the method names \ngiven in the bottom panel of the design class correspond to method names found \nin the code in Figures 12-2a and b. You\u2019ll learn more about the design class dia-\ngram in the section \u201cDesign Classes and Design Class Diagram.\u201d\nTo document the flow of execution of a particular use case, you use the \ninformation provided in a UML interaction model or a CRC card. Each of the \nfollowing three models captures essentially the same information, so you do \nnot need to use all three for any given use case. For a particular use case, you \nwould only use one. The three models are a sequence diagram, a communica-\ntion diagram, or CRC (class responsibility collaboration) cards. Sequence dia-\ngrams and communication diagrams are standard UML interaction diagrams. \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "373\nCHAPTER 12 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Fundamentals\nCRC\u00a0cards\u00a0are not standard UML, but are very popular for designing simple \nsystems. This\u00a0section introduces you to all three.\nYou first learned about sequence diagrams in Chapter 5 when you learned \nabout system sequence diagrams (SSD). An SSD only had two actors, the external \nactor and the system. A sequence diagram expands the system object to identify \nthe internal interacting objects. Figure 12-5 illustrates a simple sequence diagram. \nNotice that the: System object is no longer included, but two of the internal objects \nare shown. Also notice the message arrows between the interacting objects.\nA communication diagram is similar to a sequence diagram and serves the \nsame purpose. Some developers prefer sequence diagrams, whereas others prefer \ncommunication diagrams. Each provides basically the same information, but in \ndifferent formats. Each also has strengths and weaknesses. Figure 12-6 illus-\ntrates a communication diagram for the same use case as Figure 12-5, updating \nstudent name. Chapter 13 elaborates the details and benefits of both sequence \nand communication diagrams.\nThe third model that is used to do detailed object-oriented design and to \nprovide information for the design class diagram is CRC cards. Even though \nthe CRC card method is not a standard UML diagraming approach, it provides \na straightforward approach for detailed object-oriented design, especially for \nsimple use cases, and thus has become popular. (Remember that object-oriented \ndesign is use-case-driven\u2014design is done use case by use case.)\nCRC cards include a set of cards, with each card representing a class. \u00ad\nDevelopers \nuse 3 x 5 cards or some other method to document each card. Each card identifies \nthe class, its responsibilities (i.e., its methods), and the other classes with which it \ncollaborates. Figure 12-7 shows both front and back sides of one single CRC card. \nThe card represents a class. The list on the left is the \u201cresponsibilities.\u201d The list on \nthe front right is the other classes with which this class must \u201ccollaborate.\u201d In a later \nsection, \u201cDesigning with CRC Cards,\u201d you will learn how to use these cards.\nActor\nchangeName (studentID, name)\nnameUpdate\n:StudentUpdController\n:Student\nchangeName (name)\nFigure 12-5 Sequence diagram \nfor updating student name\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\n:Student\n1: changeName (studentID, name)\n1.3: nameUpdate\n1.2: changeName (name)\n:StudentUpdController\nActor\nFigure 12-6 Communication diagram for updating student name\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "374\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nAn object-oriented system designer must provide enough detail so a pro-\ngrammer can write the initial class definitions, including the method code. The \nfollowing sections and Chapter 13 explain these models in more depth and \nexplain how to use them to perform detailed design.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Steps of Object-Oriented Design\nThe previous section identified the primary models used for object-oriented \ndesign and the source models from analysis activities. As you saw in Figure\u00a012-1, \nan object-oriented program will have classes in three separate layers: user inter-\nface, problem domain, and database access layers. Thus, object-oriented \ndesign is the process that identifies and describes the classes within each layer \nand defines the messages that are used to invoke the methods of the involved \nclasses. Object-oriented design is an analytical, rigorous, and detailed process. \nDon\u2019t be discouraged if it takes several tries before you feel comfortable with \nthis skill.\nAnother important issue about object-oriented design is that it is \u201cuse-case-\ndriven.\u201d As was discussed earlier, a programmer will code all of the methods \nacross various classes that are required to implement the flow of execution of a \nsingle use case. Object-oriented design is done the same way. A single use case \nis chosen and the appropriate models are constructed or updated to describe the \ndetails of the use case. Note in the definition of object-oriented design, it empha-\nsizes this fact of being use-case-driven.\nBecause the process of object-oriented design is quite rigorous, sometimes \ndevelopers are tempted to skip the design step and move directly to program-\nming. In fact, with simple use cases, at times it is easier just to code the use case, \nrather than develop a formal use case design. As has been discussed earlier with \nAgile development, the objective of development activities should always be to \ncreate accurate, robust software. If a model or diagram will assist in that objec-\ntive, then it should be created. If it does not contribute directly to the end result, \nthen time should not be spent on it. However, you should not just skip modeling \nwith the assumption that a model is a distraction rather than a necessary step in \ncreating a solid design for the software.\nFigure 12-8 illustrates steps required in object-oriented design. The first \nstep is to choose a single use case. Then, you create a model, the type of which \ndepends on the complexity of the use case. The final result is to produce a com-\nplete design class diagram with supporting detail as required from interaction \ndiagrams.\nDevelopers will use different types of models depending on the complexity \nof the use case they are designing. This figure identifies three possible model \npaths for generating a final design class diagram.

{"text": "375\nCHAPTER 12 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Fundamentals\nrequire extensive design decisions. The middle path, using communication dia-\ngrams, can be used for use cases that are more complex. The path on the right, \nusing sequence diagrams, can be used for any use case, no matter the level of \ncomplexity. No matter which technique is used, detailed design does require a \ncareful thought process to ensure a solid, well-constructed solution.\nIn any of the three techniques for modeling, the objective is to identify and \ndefine the methods that are required in each class. The final design class dia-\ngram documents these required methods. It should be noted that each use case \nwill have a separate sequence diagram or communication diagram. Furthermore, \nthe design class diagram is a growing model because as each use case design is \nfinished, the new methods are added to the existing design class diagram.

{"text": "376\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Design Classes and the Design Class Diagram\nThe design class diagram contains the final definition of each class in the final \nobject-oriented software system. The primary source of information for this dia-\ngram is the problem domain model. Hence, the problem domain model serves \nas the basis for both database design, as you learned in Chapter 9, and for \nthe software classes as defined in the design class diagram. First, you need to \nunderstand the diagram itself, and then you\u2019ll learn how it is created during the \ndesign\u00a0process.\nThe domain model class diagram shows a set of problem domain classes and \ntheir associations. During analysis, because it is a discovery process, analysts \ngenerally don\u2019t worry much about the details of the attributes. However, because \nin object-oriented programming the attributes of a class must be declared as \npublic or private and each attribute must also be defined by its type, such as \ncharacter or numeric, it is important to elaborate on these details as well as \nto define the methods and parameters that are passed to the methods and the \nreturn values from methods.\nAs developers build the design class diagrams, they add many more classes \nthat were not originally defined in the domain model. Referring to Figure 12-1, \nthe Input window objects and Database access objects are examples of addi-\ntional classes that are not problem domain classes. The classes in a system can \nbe partitioned into distinct categories, such as user-interface classes or data \naccess classes. At times, designers may also develop distinct class diagrams by \nsubsystem. The following section now turns to design class diagram notation \nand discusses the design principles used in developing the first iteration of the \ndesign class diagram.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Design Class Stereotypes\nUML doesn\u2019t specifically distinguish between design class notation and domain \nmodel class diagram notation. However, practical differences occur simply \nbecause the objective of design modeling is distinct from that of domain model-\ning. Domain modeling shows things in the users\u2019 work environment and the \nnaturally occurring associations among them. At that point, the classes aren\u2019t \nspecifically software classes. After you start a design class diagram, though, you \nare specifically defining software classes. Because many different types of design \nclasses are identified during the design process, UML has a special \u00ad\nnotation\u2014\ncalled a stereotype\u2014that allows designers to designate a special type of class. \nA stereotype is simply a way to categorize a model element as a certain type. \nA stereotype extends the basic definition of a model element by indicating that \nit has some special characteristic you want to highlight. The notation for a ste-\nreotype is the name of the type placed within printer\u2019s guillemets, like this: \n\u00abcontrol\u00bb.\nFour types of design classes are considered standard stereotypes: an entity \nclass, a boundary or view class, a controller class, and a data access class. \n\u00ad\nFigure\u00a012-9 shows the notation used to identify these four stereotypes.\nAn entity class is the design stereotype for a problem domain class. It typi-\ncally describes something users deal with when doing their work. Objects of \nentity classes usually need to be remembered and are also referred to as persis-\ntent classes. A persistent class is an entity stereotyped class with objects that \nexist after the program quits. However, persistency is usually not indicated as a \nstereotype. The way to make data persistent is to write it to a file or database so \nthat it is saved and can be retrieved at a later execution of the software.\nA boundary or view class is specifically designed to live on the system\u2019s \nautomation boundary. In a desktop system, these classes would be the windows \nclasses or Web pages and all the other classes associated with the user interface. \nstereotype\u2003 a way of categorizing a model \nelement by its characteristics, indicated by \nguillemets (\u00ab \u00bb)\nentity class\u2003 a design stereotype for a \nproblem domain class\npersistent class\u2003 an entity class whose \nobjects must continue to exist after a system \nis shut down\nboundary or view class\u2003 a class that \nexists on a system\u2019s automation boundary, \nsuch as a user interface or a system \ninterface\u00a0class\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "377\nCHAPTER 12 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Fundamentals\nA boundary class could also be a system interface between a company\u2019s system \nand an external system. So a boundary stereotype is either a user or a system \ninterface class.\nA controller class mediates between the boundary classes and the entity \nclasses. In other words, its responsibility is to catch the messages from the bound-\nary class objects and send them to the correct entity class objects. It acts as a \nkind of switchboard between the boundary or view layer and the domain\u00a0layer.\nA data access class is used to retrieve data from and send data to a data-\nbase. Sometimes it is also called a database access class. Rather than insert data-\nbase access logic, including SQL statements, into the entity class methods, a \nseparate layer of classes to access the database is often included in the design.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Design Class Notation\nFigure 12-10 shows the details within a design class.

Each of the three subclasses inherits all the attributes and \nmethods of the parent Sale class. Hence, each subclass has a saleID, a saleDate, \nand so forth. In this example, each subclass also has additional attributes that \nare unique to its own specific class. Each of the subclasses also has a unique \nattribute that is underlined, such as noOfPhoneSales. As previously mentioned, \nunderlined attributes are class-level attributes and have the same characteris-\ntics as class-level methods. A class-level attribute is a static variable, and it con-\ntains the same value in all instantiated objects of the same type.\nNot only are methods and attributes inherited by the subclasses, but asso-\nciations are also inherited. In Figure 12-11, the Sale object must be associated \nwith exactly one customer. Each subclass inherits the same association; it must \nbe associated with exactly one customer. Finally, notice that the title of the Sale \nclass is italicized. As defined in Chapter 4, an italicized class name indicates that \nit is an abstract class\u2014a class that can never be instantiated. In other words, \nthere are never any Sale class objects. All orders in the system must be instanti-\nated as one of the three subclasses, which are concrete classes, meaning that \nevery order in the system will be either a TelephoneSale, an OnlineSale, or an \nInStoreSale. The purpose of an abstract class is illustrated by the figure. It pro-\nvides a central holding place for all the attributes and methods that each of the \nthree subclasses will need. This example demonstrates one way that OOP imple-\nments reuse. The methods and attributes in the abstract superclass only need to \nbe written once in order to be reused by each of the subclasses.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Developing the First-Cut Design Class Diagram\nTo illustrate how to start the design process, this section develops a first-cut \ndesign class diagram based on the domain model.

{"text": "380\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nThe first-cut design class diagram is developed by extending the domain \nmodel class diagram. It requires two steps: (1) adding type and initial value \ninformation to the attributes and (2) adding navigation visibility arrows. As \nindicated earlier, object-oriented design is use-case-driven; so, let\u2019s choose a use \ncase to start with and focus only on classes involved in that use case.\n\u275a\n\u275aElaboration of Attributes\nThe elaboration of the attributes is fairly straightforward. The type information \nis determined by the designer, based on his or her expertise. In most instances, \nall attributes are kept invisible or private and are indicated with minus signs \nbefore them. We also need to add a new compartment to each class for the addi-\ntion of method signatures.\n\u275a\n\u275aNavigation Visibility\nAs stated earlier, an object-oriented system is a set of interacting objects. The \nsequence diagrams document which interactions occur between which objects. \nHowever, for one object to interact with another, the first object must be vis-\nible to the second object. In this context, navigation visibility refers to the \nability of one object to interact with and send messages to another object. \n\u00ad\nSometimes, developers refer to navigation visibility as just navigation or vis-\nibility. However, using just the term visibility can cause confusion with attri-\nbute or method visibility. We will use either the term navigation visibility or \nnavigation to distinguish the concept from public and private visibility on \nattributes and\u00a0methods.\nFigure 12-13 shows one-way navigation visibility between the Customer \nclass and the Sale class. It is called \u201cone-way\u201d because Customer can interact \nwith Sale, but Sale does not have a direct reference back to Customer. The navi-\ngation arrow indicates that a Sale object must be visible to the Customer object. \nNotice the variable called mySale in the Customer class. This variable refers to a \nSale instance. The mySale attribute is included in the example to provide a way \nto actually implement it. This is quite different from the database concept of \nincluding a foreign key. The mySale attribute is not the value of the key to a Sale \nobject, but it is an actual programming reference to the Sale object. You could \neven think of it as having a Sale object embedded within the Customer object. \nFrom a database point of view, you would do exactly the reverse. You would put \na foreign key of the Customer in the Sale data record to capture the one-to-many \nrelationship. (One customer has many sales.)\nNow let\u2019s think about adding navigation visibility to the RMO design class \ndiagram. Remember that you are designing just the first-cut class diagram, so \nyou might continue to modify the navigation arrows as the design progresses. \nnavigation visibility\u2003 a design principle in \nwhich one object has a reference to another \nobject and thus can interact with it\nCustomer\n-accountNo: string {key}\n-name: string\n-mobilePhone: string\n-homePhone: string\n-status: string\n-mySale: Sale\n-saleID: int {key}\n-saleDate: date\n-priorityCode: string\n-shipping&Handling: currency\n-tax: currency\n-totalAmt: currency\n-mountainBucks: int\nSale\nFigure 12-13 Navigation visibility \nbetween Customer and Sale\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "381\nCHAPTER 12 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Fundamentals\nYou should ask the following basic question when building navigation visibil-\nity: Which classes need to have references to or be able to access which other \nclasses? Here are a few general guidelines:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nOne-to-many associations that indicate a superior/subordinate relationship are \nusually navigated from the superior to the subordinate\u2014for example, from \nSale to SaleItem. Sometimes, these relationships form hierarchies of navigation \nchains\u2014for example, from Promotion to ProductItem to InventoryItem.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMandatory associations, where objects in one class can\u2019t exist without \nobjects of another class, are usually navigated from the independent class to \nthe dependent class\u2014for example, from Customer to Sale.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nWhen an object needs information from another object, a navigation arrow \nmight be required, pointing either to the object itself or to its parent in a \nhierarchy.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nNavigation visibility arrows may be bidirectional\u2014for example, a Sale \nobject might need to send a message to its Customer object as well as \nthe\u00a0reverse.\nThe very first step you do when creating the first-cut design class diagram \nis to add a controller class. You will learn more about controller classes in the \nnext chapter. Basically, the controller class is a switchboard between the input \nscreens and the programming logic classes, i.e. the domain classes, for a par-\nticular use case. In our examples, we will always create a controller class for \neach use case, and place it between the user-interface classes and the problem \ndomain classes.\nFigure 12-14 is a first-cut design class diagram for the use case Create tele-\nphone sale based on the steps described earlier: add a controller class, elaborate \nattributes, and identify navigation visibility. To elaborate the attributes, you add \ntype information and visibility. To add navigation visibility, you first identify \nwhich classes may be involved and then determine the classes that require navi-\ngation visibility to other classes. For example, for the Create telephone sale use \ncase, price information is in the PromoOffering class and description informa-\ntion is in the ProductItem class. In most instances, it is unnecessary to put the \nnavigation visibility reference attribute in the class. (And, in fact, there are some \nlanguages that do not require it.) In other words, the mySale attribute is redun-\ndant to the information provided by the arrow. So, even though it was shown \nin Figure 12-13 to emphasize the concept of navigation visibility, it is left off in \nFigure 12-14 and subsequent figures.\nAs a reminder, one thing to remember about navigation visibility is that the \nclasses are programming classes, not database classes. So, we aren\u2019t thinking \nabout foreign keys in a relational database. We are thinking about object refer-\nences in a programming language.\nFigure 12-14 includes SaleHandler as the controller class. As mentioned pre-\nviously, a controller class, or use case controller, is a utility class that helps in the \nprocessing of a use case. Notice that it has navigation visibility at the top of the \nvisibility hierarchy and starts the use case by messaging a customer.\nThree points are important to note: First, as design proceeds use case by use \ncase, you need to ensure that the sequence diagrams support and implement the \nnavigation visibility that was initially defined. Second, the navigation arrows \nneed to be updated as design progresses to be consistent with the design details. \nFinally, method signatures will be added to each class based on the design deci-\nsions made when creating the interaction diagrams for the use cases.\nAs discussed earlier and shown in Figure 12-8, for use cases that are simple, \na developer will often use CRC cards to design the detail flow of execution for \nthe use case from one class to another. The next section explains how CRC \ncards can be used to design a use case.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

Devel-\nopers use this technique during design to help identify responsibilities of the \nclass and the sets of classes that collaborate for a particular use case.\nA CRC card is simply a 3 3 5 or 4 3 6 index card with lines that par-\ntition it into three areas: class name, responsibility, and collaboration classes. \n\u00ad\nFigure\u00a012-15 illustrates the two sides of a CRC card from the RMO CSMS. The \ncard is partially filled out. Along the top of the card is the name of the class. The \nleft partition lists the responsibilities for objects in this class. Responsibilities \ninclude information that the class maintains and actions that the class carries \nout in support of a particular use case. The right partition lists other classes \nwith which this class collaborates in support of a particular use case.

Because the process is to design a single use case, start \nwith a set of unused CRC cards. The first card to include should be a use \ncase controller card.\n2.\t Identify the first problem domain class that has responsibility for this use \ncase. This object will receive the first message from the use case control-\nler. Using the domain model that was developed during analysis, select one \nclass to take responsibility.

Usually, each persistent domain class will have a data access class \nto read and write to the database.\nAt the end of this process, you will have a small set of CRC cards that col-\nlaborate to support the use case. This process can be enhanced with several \nother activities. First, the CRC cards can be arranged on the table in the order \nthey are executed or called. In other words, the calling order can be determined \nat this time.\nTo begin, let\u2019s work through a simple use case. Referring back to \n\u00ad\nFigure\u00a012-8, we first choose a use case. Next, we create the first-cut design class \ndiagram with navigation.

It makes \nsense that a Customer class takes responsibility for creating and updat-\ning anything having to do with customer details such as accounts and \naddresses. The Customer class also has the responsibility to instantiate a \nnew object with a constructor method. Some developers like to include \nconstructor responsibilities, while others do not. In our example, we will \nnot include the constructor. The programmers will know that every class \nrequires at least one constructor. The input information for the constructor \ncan be found in the SSD, as shown in Figure 5-10. Figure 12-18 illustrates \nthe completion of step 2.\n3.\t For the third step, we observe from Figure 5-4 and Figure 5-10 that there \nare two other messages coming into the system. One message passes \naddress data and another message passes credit card information. Also \nnote in Figure 12-16 that there are two other classes involved in this use \ncase, Address and Account. When creating a new customer, the system \nalso needs to instantiate a new Account object, and at least one new \nAddress object, though there may also be multiple address objects created. \n\u00ad\nFigure\u00a012-19 illustrates the completion of step 3, except for the attributes, \nwhich are not being shown in this example.\n4.\t For the fourth step, we will add the user-interface classes. Input to this \ndesign step will come from two sources, the parameters on the messages \nas seen in Figure 5-10, and the screen designs and layouts designed during \ninput design. In this instance, let\u2019s assume that the user requirement is to \nhave a starting screen that captures basic information such as name, phone \nnumbers, and e-mail addresses. A second input screen will allow enter-\ning address information, multiple times if necessary. A final input screen \nwill accept credit card information. Because there may be extra processing \nrequired to verify credit information at that point, the user wanted to have \nit on a separate input screen.

The methods in the \ndesign class diagram are derived from the lists of responsibilities on each card. \nIn other words, each responsibility should translate to a method. The CRC cards \nidentify responsibilities, but do not normally include the complete method sig-\nnatures with parameters and returns. Not having to worry about parameters \nsimplifies the CRC card process, but it requires that the developer add that \ninformation when the design class diagram is completed. Also, because we have \nelected not to include the constructor responsibilities on CRC cards, we have \nnot included the constructor methods on the final design class diagram. So even \nthough there are no methods defined for Address or Account, we know that \nthere are constructor methods that execute when new objects are instantiated. If \nwe were to define multiple constructor methods with different parameters and \nreturns, we could add them to this final version of the design class diagram. \nFigure 12-22 shows the updated design class diagram of the domain layer with \nmethod signatures added for this use case.\nLet\u2019s show one more example.

Note that the SaleHandler class needs vis-\nibility to the Sale class to process a payment. Compare the responsibilities iden-\ntified on the CRC cards and the method names described in each class. Note the \nclose correlation. Also remember that we have not included constructors. So for \nexample, the SaleTransaction has a constructor method, which is not shown, to \nprocess the payment by instantiating a new SaleTransaction object.\nOften, when developers begin using CRC cards, they assign many different \nresponsibilities for a given class. For example, developers might say the SaleItem \nclass should get the price. In reality, the PromoOffering class provides the price \nand the SaleItem only uses it. In other words, it helps to think of responsibili-\nties as being similar to methods\u2014requests to do something rather than random \nactions that need to occur.\nAs method names and navigation visibility are added to the design class \ndiagram for each use case, the overall diagram grows and becomes the central \nrepository of all information about every class in the new system.

In other words, they \nindicate the \u201cgoodness\u201d of the detailed design and the implementation of the \nnew system. Although understanding and using the following design principles \nwill not guarantee a high-quality design, applying these principles will increase \nthe probability that the design is solid. Ignoring the following principles will \nalmost certainly ensure a less-than-optimal software design.\nThe following discussion of good design principles is a launching point for \nyou to understand how to design high-quality software. However, it is not a \ncomprehensive discussion. There are many good books and articles on the prin-\nciples of good object-oriented design, which further explain principles and tech-\nniques of good design.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Object Responsibility\nOne of the most fundamental principles of object-oriented design is the idea of \nobject responsibility; that is, objects should be responsible for carrying out \nsystem processing. These responsibilities are categorized in two major areas: \nknowing and doing.

{"text": "390\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nKnowing includes an object\u2019s responsibilities for knowing about its own \ndata and knowing about other classes with which it must collaborate to carry \nout use cases. Obviously, a class should know about its own data, what attri-\nbutes exist, and how to maintain the information in those attributes. It should \nalso know where to go to get information when required. For example, dur-\ning the instantiation of an object, data that aren\u2019t passed as parameters may be \nrequired. An object should know about or have navigation visibility for other \nobjects that can provide the required information. For example, in Figure 12-2, \nthe first constructor method for the Student class doesn\u2019t receive a studentID \nvalue as a parameter. Instead, the Student class takes responsibility for creat-\ning a new studentID. It will know how to create a studentID according to an \ninternal algorithm, such as an \u201cautonumber next higher number\u201d algorithm, or \nperhaps a globally unique identifier routine.\nDoing includes all the activities an object performs to complete a use case. \nSome of those activities include receiving and processing messages. Another \nactivity is to instantiate, or create, new objects that may be required for comple-\ntion of a use case. Classes must collaborate to carry out a use case, and some \nclasses are responsible for coordinating the collaboration. For example, in the \nuse case Create phone sale, the Sale class has responsibility to create SaleItem \nobjects. Another class, such as InventoryItem, is only responsible for provid-\ning information about itself. Good design dictates that the developer pay close \nattention to recognizing and assigning responsibilities to the appropriate objects.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Separation of Responsibilities or Separation of Concerns\nSeparation of responsibilities, also called separation of concerns, is a design \nprinciple that is applied to a group of classes rather than to each class indi-\nvidually. The basic idea of separation of responsibilities is to segregate classes \ninto packages or groupings based on a primary focus of processing responsi-\nbility. Separation of responsibilities is the fundamental principle behind multi-\nlayer design. In multilayer design, there are user-interface classes, business logic \nclasses, and data access classes. Each layer has a particular focus or area of \nresponsibility. Classes that share the same focus or concern are grouped together \nin a layer. This design principle allows flexibility in system deployment because \ndifferent layers, i.e., a grouping of classes, can be located on different computers \nor at different locations.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Protection from Variations\nAnother underlying principle of good design is protection from variations\u2014\nthe principle that the parts of a system that are unlikely to change should be seg-\nregated (or protected) from those that will change. As you design systems, you \nshould try to isolate the parts that will change from those that are more stable.\nProtection from variations is a principle that affects the multilayer design \npattern. Designers could mix all the user-interface logic and business logic \ntogether in the same classes. In fact, in early user-oriented, event-driven sys-\ntems, such as those built with early versions of Visual Basic and PowerBuilder, \nthe business logic was included in the view layer classes\u2014often in the Windows \ninput forms. Many Web applications also combine HTML and business logic. \nThe problem with this design was that when an interface needed to be updated, \nall the business logic had to be rewritten. A better approach is to decouple \nthe user-interface logic from the business logic. Then, the user interface can \nbe rewritten without affecting the business logic. In other words, the business \nlogic\u2014being more stable\u2014is protected from variations in the user interface.\nAlso, what if updates to the business logic require the addition of new \nclasses and new methods? For example, if the user interface is included as part \nof the business classes, then changing the business logic would impact the user \nseparation of responsibilities\u2003 a design \nprinciple that recommends segregating \nclasses into separate packages or group-\nings based on a primary focus of processing \nresponsibility\nprotection from variations\u2003 a design \nprinciple in which parts of a system that are \nunlikely to change are segregated from those \nthat will\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "391\nCHAPTER 12 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Fundamentals\ninterface. However, building the system with a use case controller allows the \nuser interface to simply send all its input messages to the use case controller \nclass. Thus, changes to the methods or classes in the business logic and domain \nlayer are isolated to the controller class. You will find that protection from vari-\nations affects almost every design decision, so you should watch for and recog-\nnize the application of this principle in all design activities.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Indirection\nIndirection is the principle of separating two classes or other system compo-\nnents by placing an intermediate class between them to serve as a link. In other \nwords, instructions don\u2019t go directly from A to B; they are sent through C first. \nOr in message terminology, don\u2019t send a message from A to B. Let A send the \nmessage to C and then let C forward it to B.\nAlthough there are many ways to implement protection from variations, \nindirection is frequently used for that purpose. Inserting an intermediate object \nallows any variation in one system to be isolated in that intermediate object. \nIndirection is also useful for many corporate security systems. For example, \nmany companies have firewalls and proxy servers that receive and send mes-\nsages between an internal network and the Internet. A proxy server appears as a \nreal server\u2014ready to receive such messages as e-mail and HTML page requests. \nHowever, it is a fake server, which catches all the messages and redistributes \nthem to the recipients. This indirection step allows security controls to be put in \nplace and protect the system.\nA common example of indirection that we have been using throughout is the \ninsertion of a use case controller. The controller is a separate class that receives \nall the inputs and directs it to the appropriate domain classes.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Coupling\nThis principle, coupling, and the next principle, cohesion, were originally \ndefined during the early days of software design and programming. However, \nboth principles continue to be extremely important and applicable to object-\noriented design.\nIn the previous examples throughout the text of the RMO class diagram, \nyou have seen that the Customer class and the Sale class are linked together in \nan association relationship. Another term for this linking is coupled. Coupling \nis a qualitative measure of how closely the classes in a design class diagram are \nlinked. A simple way to think about coupling is by the number of association \nrelationships and whole/part relationships on the design class diagram. Previ-\nously, you learned about navigation visibility, which measures what a class can \nlink to and access. Low coupling is usually better for a system than high cou-\npling. For example, a Customer object can access a Sale object that belongs to \nit. However, if it can also directly access the SaleItem, that would be too much \ncoupling. Only the Sale object should be able to access its own SaleItem objects.\nWe say that coupling is a qualitative measure because no specific number \nmeasures coupling in a system. It is a global measure that applies to a set of \nclasses for a particular use case design. It does not measure an individual class. \nA designer must develop a feel for coupling\u2014that is, recognize when there is too \nmuch or too little. Coupling is evaluated as a design progresses\u2014use case by use \ncase. Generally, if each use case design has a reasonable level of coupling, the \nentire system will too.\nRefer back to Figure 12-1 to observe the flow of messages between the \nobjects. Obviously, objects that send messages to each other must have visibility \nand thus are coupled. For the Input window object to send a message to the Stu-\ndent object, it must have visibility, or be coupled, to it. The Input window object \nisn\u2019t connected to the Database access object, so those objects aren\u2019t coupled. \nindirection\u2003 a design principle in which an \nintermediate class is placed between two \nclasses to decouple them but still link them\ncoupling\u2003 a qualitative measure of how \nclosely the classes in a design class diagram \nare linked\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "392\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nIf\u00a0we designed the system so the Input window object accessed the Database \naccess object, the overall coupling for this use case would increase; that is, there \nwould be more connections. Is that good or bad? In this simple example, it \nmight not be a problem. But for a system with 10 or more classes, too many \nconnections with visibility can cause high levels of coupling, making the system \nmore complex and therefore harder to maintain.\nSo, why is high coupling bad? The main reason is that a change in one class \nripples through the entire system and may cause methods to fail. Therefore, \nexperienced analysts make every effort to simplify coupling and reduce ripple \neffects in the design of a new system.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Cohesion\nCohesion refers to the consistency of the functions within a single class and is a \nqualitative measure of its focus or unity of purpose. Unlike coupling (where you \nwant low coupling), classes need to be highly cohesive to be well designed. For \nexample, in Figure 12-1, you would expect the Student class to have methods\u2014\nthat is, functions\u2014to enter student information, such as identification number \nor name. That would represent a unity of purpose and a highly cohesive class. \nBut what if that same object also had methods to make classroom assignments \nor assign professors to courses? The cohesiveness of the class would be reduced.\nClasses with low cohesion have several negative effects. First, they are hard \nto maintain. Because they perform many different functions, they tend to be \noverly sensitive to changes within the system, suffering from ripple effects. \n\u00ad\nSecond, it is hard to reuse such classes because they have many different\u2014and \noften unrelated\u2014functions. For example, a button class that processes button \nclicks can easily be reused. However, a button class that processes both button \nclicks and user log-ins has limited reusability. A final drawback is that classes \nwith low cohesion are usually difficult to understand. Frequently, their func-\ntions are intertwined and their logic is complex.\nAlthough there is no firm metric to measure cohesiveness, we can think \nabout classes as having very low, low, medium, or high cohesion. Remember, \nhigh cohesion is the most desirable. An example of very low cohesion is a class \nthat has responsibility for services in different functional areas, such as a class \nthat accesses both the Internet and a database. These two types of activities are \ndifferent and accomplish different purposes. To put them together in one class \ncauses very low cohesion.\nAn example of low cohesion is a class that has different responsibilities, but \nin related functional areas\u2014for example, a class that handles all database access \nfor every table in the database. It would be better to have different classes to \naccess customer information, order information, and inventory information. \nAlthough the functions are the same\u2014that is, they access the database\u2014the \ntypes of data passed and retrieved are very different. Thus, a class that is con-\nnected to the entire database isn\u2019t as reusable as one that is only connected to the \nCustomer table.\nAn example of medium cohesion is a class that has closely related responsi-\nbilities, such as a single class that maintains customer information and customer \naccount information. A better design would be to define two highly cohesive \nclasses: One class could be defined for customer information, such as names \nand addresses, and another class or set of classes could be defined for customer \naccounts, such as balances, payments, credit information, and all financial activ-\nity. If the customer information and the account information are limited, they \ncould be combined into a single class with medium cohesiveness. Either medium \nor highly cohesive classes can be acceptable in systems design.\nNow let\u2019s begin the detailed design process by investigating the properties \nand details of the design class diagram.\ncohesion\u2003 a qualitative measure of the \nfocus or unity of purpose within a single class\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

One method of determining which objects \ncollaborate is to use class responsibility collaboration \n(CRC) cards. For simple use cases, a set of CRC cards \nmay be sufficient to write code. For more complex use \ncases, other interaction diagrams are normally used.\nOne reason that we suggest a more formal system \nof design, rather than just starting to write code is \nthat the final system is much more robust and main-\ntainable. Design as a rigorous activity builds better \nsystems. Some fundamental principles should be con-\nsidered as a system is developed; specifically, two criti-\ncal ideas are coupling and cohesion. A good system \nhas low coupling between the classes, and each of the \nclasses has high cohesion. Another important principle \nis \u201cprotection from variations,\u201d meaning that some \nparts of the system should be protected from and not \ntightly coupled to other parts of the system that are \nless stable and subject to change. Being a good devel-\noper entails learning and following the principles of \ngood design.\nThe ultimate responsibility of system developers is to \nwrite computer software that solves a business prob-\nlem. This chapter focuses on how to configure and \ndevelop the solution system\u2014that is, how to design \nthe details of the new system. Systems design is the \nbridge that puts business requirements in terms that \nthe programmers can use to write the software that \nbecomes the solution system.\nUsing all the requirements models as well as the \narchitectural design, object-oriented design extends \nthe models so programming can proceed. The objec-\ntive of object-oriented design is to determine the \nmethods within individual classes that are needed to \nimplement the use cases. The process of design is use-\ncase-driven, in that it is done one use case at a time.\nThe process of object-oriented design can be \ndivided into two major areas: developing a design class \ndiagram (DCD) and identifying the methods for each \nuse case via an interaction diagram. The DCD is usu-\nally developed in two steps.

In Figure 12-8, you learned the \napproach to (1) select a use case, (2) identify the classes involved and begin the \ndesign class diagram, (3) choose a modeling technique to identify the messages \nand methods, and (4) finalize the class methods in the design class diagram.\nThis chapter pursues object-oriented detailed design in more depth and \nformality. This chapter focuses on the foundation principles, which are based \non the concepts of use case realization by using UML interaction diagrams \nand design patterns. You will learn how to use communication diagrams and \nsequence diagrams to extend the input messages and define internal messages. \nThese techniques will first focus on the problem domain classes and then extend \nto multilayer design.\nThe last section of this chapter is a brief introduction to design patterns. \nAs with any engineering discipline, certain procedures have become tried and \nproven solutions. Even though object-oriented development is a relatively young \nengineering discipline, it offers standard ways to design use cases that lead to \nsolid, well-constructed solutions.

The first \ndevelopment iteration had gone pretty well, although \nthere were a few snags because the team was still learn-\ning the ins and outs of iterative development projects. \nBill Santora, the project leader, was discussing some \nof the system\u2019s technical details with Charlie Hensen, \none of his team leaders, in preparation for the iteration \nretrospective.\n\u201cHow is the team feeling about doing detailed \n\u00ad\ndesign?\u201d Bill asked Charlie, who was one of the early \ncritics of doing more formal design. \u201cI know some of \nthe programmers wanted to just start coding from the \nuse case descriptions that were developed with the \n \nusers. They weren\u2019t very happy about taking the time to \n \ndesign. Is that still a problem?\u201d\n\u201cIt really has worked out quite well,\u201d Charlie said. \n\u201cAs you know, I was skeptical at first and thought it \nwould waste a lot of time. Instead, it has allowed us to \nwork together better because we know what the other \nteam members are doing. I also think the system is \nmuch more solid. We\u2019re all using the same approach, and \nwe\u2019ve discovered that there are quite a few classes we \nshare. Of course, we don\u2019t waste a lot of time making \nfancy drawings. We do document our designs with tem-\nporary drawings, but that is about as far as we take it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you say were the strengths and weak-\nnesses of our approach?\u201d Bill asked, \u201cOr are there ways \nyou think we could do it better in this next iteration?\u201d\n\u201cI really like the approach of first doing a rough de-\nsign using CRC cards,\u201d Charlie replied. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have \na couple of users there with us to verify that our col-\nlaborations are correct. For the simple use cases, we \ncan work with the users to lay out the user interface. \nBetween the CRC cards and the user-interface specifi-\ncations, we should have enough to program from, espe-\ncially now that we have the basic structure set up. Then, \nfor the more complex use cases, we can go ahead and \ndo a detailed design with communication diagrams or \nsequence diagrams. The nice thing about these interac-\ntion diagrams is that they\u2019re detailed enough for us to \nhand the designs over to some of the junior program-\nmers. It makes them much more effective in their team \ncontributions.\u201d\n\u201cSo, would you change our approach or do you think \nit\u2019s working the right way?\u201d Bill asked, still looking for \nways to improve the process.\n\u201cWell, it really is working pretty well right now,\u201d \nCharlie said. \u201cOne thing I really like about it is that we \nhave a common domain class diagram that everyone \ncan access and review. That really helps when you\u2019re \nready to insert some code into a class to check and see \nwhat is already there. The central repository for all our \ncode and for the diagrams we do formalize is a great \ntool. I wonder if there is a way to get more use out of \nthat tool.

{"text": "399\nCHAPTER 13 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Use Case Realization\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Object-Oriented Design with Interaction Diagrams\nThe discussion of CRC cards in Chapter 12 introduced the idea of collaborating \nobjects to execute various use cases. Design sessions using CRC cards focus on \nthe problem domain classes and their responsibilities. Even though we did add \nmultilayer classes to the CRC cards, the actual details of how all the layers and \nclasses work together was not addressed. Because the CRC card method focuses \non simple use cases, the details of the interactions between classes and layers is \nleft to the programmer. This chapter describes in depth the detailed design of all \nlayers of a multilayer system.\nIn Figure 12-1, there are three objects representing the three layers of a system. \nEach object has certain responsibilities. The input window object has the primary \nresponsibility of formatting and presenting student information on the screen.\nThe student object represents the middle layer, or business logic layer, for \nthe use case. This chapter formalizes the process of precisely identifying meth-\nods and defining method signatures, particularly for this layer.\nThe database access object represents the third layer in the multilayer design. \nIt is responsible for connecting to the database, reading the student information, \nand sending it back to the student object. It is also responsible for writing the \nstudent information back to the database when necessary. This object doesn\u2019t \ncome from a problem domain class; it is a utility object created by the designer.\nSeveral questions should come to mind as you review a detailed systems design. \nFirst, how do all these objects get created in memory? For example, how and when \ndoes the student object get created? How about the database access object? Other \nquestions include: Will other objects be necessary? What object represents authen-\ntication? What is the life span of each object? Maybe the student object should go \naway after the update\u2014but what about the database access object?\nThe method used to extend the process of detailed design is called use case \nrealization. In use case realization, each use case is taken individually to deter-\nmine all the classes that collaborate on it. As part of that process, any other util-\nity or support classes are identified. Care is taken during this process to define \nthe classes so the integrity of the multilayer architectural design is maintained. \nAs the details of the classes are designed\u2014use case by use case\u2014the design class \ndiagram is also updated as necessary.\nAs you saw in Figure 12-8, in addition to CRC cards, there are two other \nmodels that are useful for systems design\u2014communication diagrams and \nsequence diagrams. Developing interaction diagrams is at the heart of object-\noriented design. The realization of a use case\u2014determining what objects col-\nlaborate and the messages they send to each other to carry out the use case\u2014is \ndone through the development of an interaction diagram. Two types of inter-\naction diagrams can be used during design: communication diagrams and \nsequence diagrams.\nBoth communication diagrams and sequence diagrams are a type of UML \ninteraction diagram. Figure 13-1 is a partial class diagram illustrating this fact. \nIt also shows a few composition classes for each diagram class.\nEach type of diagram is capable of providing a rigorous method for use case \nrealization. Interaction diagrams, as the name implies, focus on the interac-\ntions between the objects that are required to execute a particular use case. The \ninteractions between the objects are called messages. These methods translate \ndirectly to the class methods that support the use case. We saw a little bit of \nthis idea with the \u201cresponsibilities\u201d that are identified on CRC cards. However, \ninteraction diagrams are more formal and precise in defining these interactions \nbetween objects and across layers.\nBoth communication diagrams and sequence diagrams provide the same \nbasic information. However, communication diagrams are a little less detailed \nand provide a broad \u201coverview\u201d picture of the interactions. Sequence diagrams \nuse case realization\u2003 the process \nof elaborating the detailed design with \ninteraction diagrams for a particular use case\ncommunication diagram\u2003 type of inter\u00ad\naction diagram that emphasizes the objects \nthat send and receive messages for a specific \nuse case\nsequence diagram\u2003 type of interaction \ndiagram that emphasizes the sequence of \nmessages sent between objects for a specific \nuse case\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

This chapter begins the discussion with communication dia-\ngrams and then moves to sequence diagrams. First, the following section briefly \ndiscusses the concept of a use case controller.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0The Use Case Controller\nThe previous chapter briefly introduced the concept of a use case controller in \nthe discussion of CRC cards, but did not elaborate on its use. In reality, a con-\ntroller class is part of a popular design technique called Model-View-Controller. \n(This technique is discussed in more detail in the \u201cUse Case Controller\u201d section \nunder \u201cDesign Patterns.\u201d)\nLet us formalize the concept of a use case controller. For any particular use \ncase, messages come from the external actor to a windows class\u2014that is, an \nelectronic input form\u2014and then to a problem domain class. One issue in sys-\ntems design is the question of which problem domain class should receive input \nmessages to reduce coupling, maintain highly cohesive domain classes, and pro-\ntect from variations between the user interface and the domain layer. (Do you \nremember these good design principles discussed in Chapter 12?) Designers often \ndefine intermediary classes that act as buffers between the user interface and the \ndomain classes. These classes are called use case controllers. For example, the \nuse case Fill shopping cart might have a controller class named CartHandler.\nA use case controller acts as a switchboard, taking input messages and rout-\ning them to the correct domain class. In effect, the use case controller acts as an \nintermediary between the outside world and the internal system. What if a par-\nticular window object needs to send messages to several problem domain objects? \nWithout the use case controller, the input window would need references to all \nthese domain objects. The coupling between the input window object and the \ninternal system would be very high; there would be many connections. The cou-\npling between the user-interface objects and the problem domain objects could \nbe reduced by making a single use case controller object to handle all the input \nmessages. In this way, domain layer design classes can remain more cohesive by \nfocusing only on the precise functions that truly belong to that domain object.\nThe following examples define a controller class for each use case. This is \na common practice, and many development environments (such as Java Struts) \nautomatically define a controller class for each use case. Of course, this creates \nmany artifact objects in a system. If there are 100 use cases, there would be \n100 use case controller artifact objects. To reduce the number of controllers, \ndevelopers sometimes combine the control of several closely related use cases \ninto a single use case controller. Either approach, if done judiciously, provides a \nLink\nMessage\nObject\nInteractionDiagram\nCommunicationDiagram\nSequenceDiagram\nTimeline\nFigure 13-1 Communication diagrams and sequence diagrams are interaction diagrams\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Sometimes, such classes are called artifacts or \nartifact objects.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Use Case Realization with Communication Diagrams\nAdaptive projects that use iteration and Agile modeling techniques minimize the \nformality of design diagrams. In this chapter (and possibly for your homework \nassignments), the diagrams will be developed using Microsoft Visio. However, \nin real projects, hand-drawn diagrams can be scanned and transmitted to all \nthe team members just as easily. Design diagrams are helpful in communicating \ndesign decisions throughout the team.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Understanding Communication Diagrams\nA communication diagram consists of actors, objects, links, and messages. \n\u00ad\nFigure 13-2 illustrates how these various components are illustrated on \n \nthe diagram.\nThese components have the following characteristics:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nActor. This represents an external role of the person or thing that initiates \nthe use case by sending the initial message. The actor will also send any \nother messages that are external to the system. These messages can come \ninto the system through data that is entered on forms. They can also come \nelectronically by other external devices or systems.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nObject. The objects are the instantiated class objects that perform actions \nto help carry out the use case. In design diagram terms, they receive the \nmessages that request services. Objects can both receive messages and send \nmessages. Note we use object notation\u2014with a colon and underlining\u2014\nand not class notation. The execution of a use case is performed by instan-\ntiated objects and not classes.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nLink. Links are simply the connectors that illustrate the flow of the messages. \nThese links do not mean the same as the navigation visibility arrows, although \nthey frequently exist between the same objects. They are only used to show \nwhere the messages flow. Messages can flow in either direction on a link.\nAn actor who sends\nthe initial message\nAn object that\nreceives a message\nand sends other\nmessages\n1: firstMessage ( )\n4: finalResponse ( )\n2: secondMessage ( )\n3: returnMessage ( )\nActor\n:Object\n:Object2\nA message arrow and\ndescriptive name\nA link between\nsymbols that send or\nreceive messages\nFigure 13-2 Symbols used in a communication diagram\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "402\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMessage. Messages are a primary element of the diagram. A message has \nan originating object or actor, and a destination object or actor. A message \nis a request for service. A message can also be a return of data from a previ-\nous message. A message will invoke a service in an object. In programming \nterms, a message is the same as a procedure call or a method call.\nChapter 5 first presented the idea of a message in the discussion of a system \nsequence diagram. Messages in a communication diagram have the same mean-\ning. However, the syntax of the message is slightly different. The syntax con-\ntains five elements, all of which are optional. The format of a communication \ndiagram message is the following:\n[true/false condition] sequence-number: return-value: 5 message-name \n(parameter-list)\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nTrue/false condition. This is a condition that is tested for true or false. If \nit is true, then the message is sent; if false, the message is not sent. It only \napplies to sending the message. It is optional.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSequence number. The sequence number is used to identify the order, \nor sequence, of the messages. They can be simply numbered by integers. \nDevelopers also often use hierarchical dot notation (i.e., 1.0, 1.2, 2.1.3, \netc.) to denote dependency as well as sequence. For example, if a use case \nhas two separate input messages, each with several subsequent messages \nthat travel the same links, they could be uniquely partitioned by using  \n1.0 and 2.0 series. Note that a colon follows the sequence number.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReturn-value. The return value is a value that the message returns after the \ncompletion of the service requested in the forward part of the message. In \nprogramming terms, this is similar to a method return value. Return values \ncan be returned either with this format (i.e., as part of the message) or as a \nseparate return message.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMessage-name. This is the name of the message. As noted, it usually uses \ncamel case with the initial letter lowercase. To name the message, it is \nusually best to describe the service that is requested from the destination \nobject. For example, createAccount could be a message name that requests \nthe specific service from the destination object. Notice that if a return-value \nis given, that the two items are separated by a \u201c:=\u201d sign.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nParameter-list. The parameter list contains those items that are being passed \nto the destination object via the message. Again, in programming terms, \nthese are the arguments that would be passed when a method is invoked.\nLet\u2019s look at a typical communication diagram and take note of the informa-\ntion it provides and its characteristics. Remember that a communication diagram is \nuseful to design and document use cases of medium complexity. In other words, this \ntype of diagram works best for use cases that are not too large with many messages. \nA major benefit of a communication diagram is that it provides a snapshot view of \nthe classes and messages. However, a disadvantage is that there is not much space \nallowed for messages, so it can easily become cluttered with overlapping information. \nFigure\u00a013-3 is a communication diagram for the Create customer account use case. \nRefer back to Figure 12-19 and recall the set of CRC cards created for this same use \ncase. You might want to compare the two solutions, shown in Figure 12-19 and 13-3.\nThis use case has three input messages: createNewCustomer, enterAddress, \nand enterAccount. Figure 13-3 shows those three messages as input messages \ncoming from the Clerk actor into the :CustomerHandler controller object. Note \nthe sequence numbers indicate the order of the messages. The first message spec-\nifies the individual parameters that are to be passed with the message. However, \ndue to space limitations, Figure 13-3 does not show the detail parameters for \nmessage 2 or 3. The programmer would have to look at the class diagram and \ndetermine what information needs to be passed, or he could provide a footnote \nto the drawing to provide that additional detail. On the second message, the \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

This is called a multiply occurring message.\nThe next set of messages, 1.1, 2.1, and 3.1, use the hierarchical dot notation \nto indicate that they are part of a sequence. Looking at 1.1, notice that it has a \nreturn value. Also note that the Customer object is named aC:Customer. The \nunderline indicates an object and not a class. The aC: is the name or identifier for \nthis particular object. That information (i.e., the name of the object) is returned \nto the :CustomerHandler object. Referring back to Figure 12-16, note that the \n:CustomerHandler object has navigation visibility to the :Customer object. This \nmechanism of returning the identifier of the newly created :Customer object \nprovides this navigation visibility. Thus, the :CustomerHandler object can pass \nthe other messages to the correct object because it has a reference to it.\nThe next set of messages, 2.2 and 3.2, have a similar form. Each sends a \ncreate message to the appropriate object and returns the identifier of the newly \ncreated object. These two messages include the detail parameters to be passed. \nIn the earlier messages, 2, 2.1, 3, and 3.1 only abbreviated parameter lists were \ngiven. The full parameter list is more correct. The abbreviated lists were used \npurely to save space. Remember, the purpose of modeling is to provide guide-\nlines for programming. So designers sometimes take liberties with the formality \nof the model, as long as it is still understandable.\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that some return messages have been left off \nfrom :CustomerHandler to the Clerk. A system will normally return and display \nthe data that was entered so that the actor can verify that the correct informa-\ntion was stored. In Figure 13-2, the method of returning data is indicated with \na return message.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Object-Oriented Design with Communication Diagrams\nNow that you can read and understand a communication diagram, it\u2019s time to \nlearn how to do use case realization using this technique. You will work through \nthe same use case, Create customer account. As you work through the example, \nyour understanding of object-oriented design should deepen due to the detailed \ndiscussion of the design steps.\nReferring back to Figures 12-3 and 12-8, note the models and information \nthat are prerequisite to detailed object-oriented design. First, you should have \ncompleted the first-cut design class diagram. This gives you a preliminary idea \nof what domain classes will be involved and the logical navigation visibility rela-\ntionships. From the analysis models, it is helpful to have either an activity dia-\ngram or a system sequence diagram. In fact, in the ideal world, both would be \navailable along with a detailed use case description.\n1: createNewCustomer\n         (name, mobilePh, homePh, email)\n1\n.1: aC := createNewCustomer\n         (name, mobilePh, homePh, email)\n2: *enterAddress (addressInfo)\n3: enterAccount (cc-info)\n2.1: enterAddress (addressInfo)\n3.1: enterAccount (cc-info)\nClerk\n\u00abcontroller\u00bb\n:CustomerHandler\naC:Customer\naAdd:Address\naAcc:Account\n2.2: aAdd := createAddress\n         (accNo, type, no, street, city, state, zip)\n3.2: aAcc :=createAccount\n         (accNo. type, CCNo, CCDate)\nFigure 13-3 Communication diagram for Create customer account use case\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

The \nselection of which classes to include is purely an estimate at this point because \nwe will not determine all the classes until we proceed with the design steps. \nHowever, in this simple example, the preliminary assessment is accurate. Do not \nworry if you do happen to omit some required classes. It will become evident \nduring the design process if something is missing.\nThe other source of input information comes from the analysis \u00ad\nmodels. \nChapter 5 developed several models for this use case, including a use case \ndescription (Figure 5-2), an activity diagram (Figure 5-4), and a system \nsequence diagram (Figure 5-10).

Identify and include the parameters that the destination object will \nrequire to carry out the requested service. Identify and name any return \nmessages or return values that need to be returned to origin objects.\nLooking at the first input message, createNewCustomer (name, phones, \nemails), we decide the following:\n1.\t The required classes for this message are CustomerHandler and Customer.\n2.\t The required message is createNewCustomer and comes from the Clerk to \nthe :CustomerHandler. The :CustomerHandler then forwards that same \nmessage to the :Customer object. The :Customer object is the appropriate \nobject to carry out this service. The constructor method in the Customer \nclass instantiates a new :Customer object. This is shown in the diagram \nwith a message directly to the :Customer object.\n3.\t The name of the message is appropriate as given in the SSD.

There also may be Loop \nframes, Alt frames, and Opt frames as well as repeating inputs and outputs. \nA\u00a0Loop frame denotes a set of messages within a loop. An Alt frame is similar \nto an if-then-else statement or switch statement, which allows the firing of dif-\nferent sets of messages. An Opt frame is an optional invocation of a set of mes-\nsages. You will see examples of these later in this chapter. First, let\u2019s review the \nbasic elements in a sequence diagram.\nFigure 13-11 is a sample sequence diagram. In many ways, it is similar to a \ncommunication diagram. The actor is an external role, in this case, a Clerk. The \nboxes are instantiated objects from the corresponding classes. Object notation is \nused. Some objects are named objects, such as aC:Customer. The primary benefit \nof the sequence diagram is the ability to lay out the messages from top to bot-\ntom to emphasize the sequence of firing. Below each actor and object is a lifeline, \nwhich is used as an indicator of the life of the object. Messages are attached to \nthe lifeline either as a source point or a destination point. Attached to locations \nof each lifeline are vertical boxes representing activation lifelines. You might \nconsider these activation lifelines the time period when a method is executing. \n \n(type, no, street, city, state, zip)\nenterAccount (type, CCNo, CCDate)\naAdd: =createAddress\n   (accNo, type, no, street, city, state, zip)\n(type, CCNo, CCDate)\n*enterAddress (type, no, street, city, state, zip)\n(name, mobilePh, homePh, email)\n\u00abcontroller\u00bb\n:CustomerHandler\naC:Customer\naAdd:Address\naAcc:Account\nClerk\ncreateNewCustomer (name, mobilePh, homePh, email)\n(type, no, street, city, state, zip)\n(type, CCNo, CCDate)\nenterAccount (type, CCNo, CCDate)\nenterAddress (type, no, street, city, state, zip)\naAcc: =createAccount (accNo, type, CCNo, CCDate)\nA Method to return data;\nnote dashed arrow\nA method to return data\nActivation Lifeline\nLifeline\nVertical position of\nmessages indicates\nsequence of fring\nSend a constructor message\neither to the object itself, or\nto its lifeline\naC :=createNewCustomer (name, mobilePh, homePh, email)\nFigure 13-11 Sample sequence diagram from Create customer account use case\nactivation lifeline\u2003 a representation of the \nperiod during which a method of an object is \nalive and executing\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

There are two ways to indicate data \nbeing returned, either by a return assignment with the \u201c:=\u201d operator, or as a return \nmessage using a dashed arrow. Messages that invoke a constructor can be sent \neither to a lifeline or to the object itself. Both examples are shown in the figure.\nAs with a communication diagram, when a message is sent from an originat-\ning object to a destination object, in programming terms, it means that the origi-\nnating object is invoking a method on the destination object. Thus, by defining \nthe messages to various internal objects, we are actually identifying the methods \nof that object. The data that is passed by the messages corresponds to the input \nparameters of the methods. The return data on a message is the return value from \na method. Hence, once a use case is realized with this detailed design process, \nthe set of classes and required methods can be extracted so programming can \n \nbe completed.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Design Process for Use Case Realization\nThe design process for using sequence diagrams is the same as it is for com-\nmunication diagrams. The starting point for the detailed design of a use case \nis always its SSD and the first-cut design class diagram. Other models, such as \na use case description and activity diagram, are also helpful. Remember that \nthe SSD only has two lifelines\u2014one for the actor and one for the system. Start-\ning with the SSD, each input message is taken, one at a time, and extended \nto all of the internal classes so that the desired result is obtained. Any data to \nbe returned is identified and added. Figure 13-11 is the sequence diagram solu-\ntion of the Create customer account use case. It was developed using the same \nthree steps that were used to extend communication diagram messages. You will \nnotice that it has the same set of messages, but displayed differently.\nLet us analyze this solution based on some of the principles of good design \nthat were discussed in Chapter 12. The use case controller provides the link \nbetween the internal objects and the external environment. The responsibilities \nassigned to :CustomerHandler are to catch incoming messages, distribute them \nto the correct internal domain objects, and return the required information to \nthe external environment.\nThe responsibility assigned to :Customer is to be in charge of creating itself \nand to control the other required updates to subordinate objects. The :Address \nand :Account objects create themselves. Coupling is straightforward, being basi-\ncally vertical on the hierarchy. Thus, the assignment of responsibilities and cor-\nresponding messages conforms to good design principles. Other issues will need \nto be addressed as the design expands to include three layers.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Sequence Diagram: Fill Shopping Cart Use Case\nThis section looks at a slightly more complex example of a sequence diagram. \nWith this example, you will see the strength of sequence diagrams in modeling \ncomplex use cases. Figure 13-12 is an activity diagram for the Fill shopping \ncart use case. You will remember from Figure 3-15 that this use case \u201cincluded\u201d \nthree other use cases, as shown in Figure 13-12. By designing the use case in this \nmanner, with other use cases included, our solution will only have to focus on \nthose functions that actually add items to the shopping cart.\nThe SSD for this use case is quite simple. Figure 13-13 shows that there are \nonly two input messages to the system: adding an item and adding an acces-\nsory item. As you analyze the SSD, notice that adding an item to the shopping \ncart and adding an accessory to the cart are the same operation. The only dif-\nference is that adding accessories requires a loop for any multiple accessories \nadded for that same item. Because this is the only difference, we can simplify the \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

(Note: An additional class, \n\u00ad\nAccessoryPackage, is required for the use case Search and view accessories, but \nbecause we aren\u2019t designing that use case, it isn\u2019t required for this solution.)\nWe begin this design by developing the first-cut design class diagam. Refer \nback to Figure 4-23, which presented the class diagram for the CSMS sales subsys-\ntem. Using that diagram, we can identify the classes that are required for this use \ncase. The Customer, Cart, and CartItem classes are necessary because the use case \nwill be adding items for this customer to the customer\u2019s cart. To create a cart item, \nthe system will need to know what product it is, if there are items in stock, and \nthe price for the item. Therefore, other classes that are required are InventoryItem, \nProductItem, and PromoOffering. As we develop the solution, we may have to add \nclasses, but this appears to be sufficient for now. Navigation visibility between \nthese classes will be from the controller to the Customer class and to the Cart class \nonce it has been created. The Cart class will be able to access the CartItem class. \nThe CartItem class should have visibility to the other classes, such as ProductItem \nCustomer\nSystem\nSearch for product\nSearch and view\naccessories\nLook at product\nreviews\nSelect options and\nquantity\nAdd to cart\nAdd to cart\nSelect accessory\noptions and\nquantity\nFigure 13-12 Activity diagram for \nthe Fill shopping cart use case\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Figure 13-14 shows \nthe first-cut design class diagram, which includes several additions to the domain \nmodel. In Figure 13-14, several key identifier fields have been added to some classes. \nOne correction to the domain model was also made. In Chapter 9 during the nor-\nmalization process the regularPrice attribute was moved out of the PromoOffering \nclass and into the ProductItem class, which is where it correctly belongs.\nTo design this use case, we will follow the same steps that were outlined in \nthe \u201cExtend Input Messages\u201d section for use case realization using communi-\ncation diagrams. Even though this use case has fewer input messages than the \nprevious example (Create customer account), the processing required to execute \na message is more complex.\nLet\u2019s take the first input message, addItemToCart. This message first comes \nto the CartHandler. Obviously, it is not possible to add an item to a cart if there \nis no cart. So how do you create a cart? One solution is to require the user/actor \nto create a new cart. This is a poor idea. It is never a good idea to require the \nuser to perform an act if the system can do it automatically. The system can be \nmade smart enough to know if it needs to create an online cart first. How can \nthe system know? There are several ways to design this process. Let\u2019s use the \nperfect technology assumption that the user has logged on. So :CartHandler \nshould have a reference to the :Customer object. However, if there is no refer-\nence to an online cart object, then it needs to be created. The next question is, \nwhat object should create the new online cart object? From the domain model, \nyou can see that an online cart object has a cardinality of exactly one to a cus-\ntomer object. So a cart cannot exist without a customer, and from the design \nclass diagram, you can see that the customer must have visibility to the online \ncart. Hence :Customer is the obvious object to create the :OnLineCart object.\nFigure 13-15 shows this first step. The :CartHandler checks to see if it is the \nfirst item, and if so, sends a createCart message to :Customer. Notice the true/\nfalse condition on that message. The :Customer object sends a create message \ndirectly to :OnlineCart to instantiate a new cart. A reference to the new cart is \nreturned first to :Customer, which then forwards it on to :CartHandler. Now \nboth have navigation visibility to the newly created online cart.

Also, \nnotice that if it is not the first item, then this sequence of messages is skipped and \nthe system goes directly to adding the item to the cart. Because :Cart\u00ad\nHandler \nnow has visibility to :OnlineCart, it sends a message directly to the cart to add \nthe appropriate item. :OnlineCart creates a new cart item and passes the data to \n:CartItem to instantiate a new cart item. :CartItem retrieves the necessary data \nto complete its attributes. We are assuming in this case that the price is the pro-\nmotional price. Once the cart item has created itself, it returns information back \nto :OnlineCart, which returns it to :CartHandler and eventually to the user/\ncustomer. Figure 13-16 illustrates this next set of messages.\nAs you can see, this simple input message extends to quite a bit of internal \nactivity. How did we know what to do? We observed the attributes of :CartItem \nand noted what classes contained the information that was needed. :CartItem is \nresponsible for obtaining the data to instantiate itself. It simply went to the nec-\nessary objects to obtain that data.\nReferring back to Figure 13-13, note that there is another input message, \naddAccessoryToCart (\u2026), with the same input parameters. As you think about \nthis, note that adding an accessory is the same activity as adding an item. Acces-\nsories are just items that are associated with products for promotions to the cus-\ntomer. Once an accessory item is selected, it simply becomes an item. Hence, the \nsame set of internal messages are required. The only difference is that adding \naccessories is an optional activity.

To send a message \nto the correct destination object, the source object must have visibility to the \ndestination object. Remember that the purpose of doing design is to prepare \nfor programming. As a designer, you must think about how the program will \nwork and consider programming issues.

Several \nassumptions are also implicit in this process.\n\u275a\n\u275aGuidelines\nDesigning a use case or scenario by using sequence diagrams involves perform-\ning these tasks:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nTake each input message and determine all the internal messages that result \nfrom that input. For each message, determine its objective. Determine what \ninformation is needed, what class needs it (the destination), and what class \nprovides it (the source).\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAs you work with each input message, identify the complete set of classes \nthat will be affected by the message. In other words, select all the objects \nfrom the domain class diagram that need to be involved. In Chapter 5, you \nlearned about use case preconditions and postconditions. Any classes that are \nlisted in either the preconditions or postconditions should be included in the \ndesign. Other classes to include are those that are created, classes updated \nduring the use case, and those that provide information used in the use case.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFlesh out the components for each message; that is, add iteration, true/false con-\nditions, return values, and passed parameters. The passed parameters should be \nbased on the attributes found in the domain class diagram. Return values and \npassed parameters can be attributes, but they may also be objects from classes.\nThese three steps will produce the preliminary design. Refinements and \nmodifications may be necessary; again, we are focusing only on the problem \ndomain classes involved in the use case.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

{"text": "417\nCHAPTER 13 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Use Case Realization\n\u275a\n\u275aAssumptions\nThe development of the first-cut sequence diagram is based on several assump-\ntions, including:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPerfect technology assumption. You first encountered this assumption in \nChapter 5, when identifying business events. The assumption continues \nhere. You don\u2019t include messages such as the user having to log on.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPerfect memory assumption. You might have noticed our assumption that \nthe necessary objects were in memory and available for the use case. We \ndidn\u2019t ask whether those objects were created in memory. We will change \nthis assumption when we get to multilayer design. In multiple-layer design, \nwe do include the steps necessary to create objects in memory.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPerfect solution assumption. The first-cut sequence diagram assumes that \nthere are no exception conditions. No logic is included to handle a situation \nin which the requested catalog or product isn\u2019t found. More serious excep-\ntion conditions, such as the failure of a credit check, might also be encoun-\ntered. Many developers design the basic processing steps first and then add \nthe other messages and processes to handle the exception conditions later. \nWe do the same here.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Developing a Multilayer Design\nSo far in the development of the sequence diagram, we have focused only on the \nclasses in the problem domain layer. In many instances, this may be sufficient \ndocumentation to program the solution\u2014either by yourself or with another pro-\ngrammer. Once you have a solid design for the problem domain classes, adding \nthe view layer and the data access layer is a straightforward, if time-consuming, \nprocess. Conforming to the principles of Agile modeling, we don\u2019t want to cre-\nate diagrams unless there is real benefit. We also don\u2019t normally keep the design \n\u00ad\ndiagrams as documentation because over time, the system will be modified and \nthe diagrams will become obsolete. As Agile modeling suggests, be prudent in the \n \ndevelopment of models. However, there are times when it is important to see the \ntotal picture and identify the need and use of the view layer classes and the\u00a0data \naccess layer classes. A system developer needs to know how to do \u00ad\ncomplete \ndesign for those instances when it is necessary.\nEvery system will need view layer classes to represent the input and out-\nput screens for the application. Data access layer classes aren\u2019t always required. \nThe data access layer is required when the business logic is fairly complex and \nshould be isolated from the SQL statements that access the database. The CRC \ncards example in Chapter 12 for the Create customer account use case showed \nan example of a three-layer design with both view and data access classes (see \n\u00ad\nFigure 12-21). Because CRC cards is an informal technique, we simply added \nthe classes without much discussion of how they are to be connected to the \nproblem domain classes. The following sections develop that same example but \nwith a sequence diagram. This more rigorous modeling technique highlights the \nissues involved with three-layer design. First, we add the view layer, then the \ndata access layer.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Designing the View Layer\nIn Chapter 8, you learned how to do the design of the user interface. In \u00ad\nreality, \nuser-interface design is both an analysis and a design activity. Quite a bit of \ndiscovery and understanding is being developed as the systems analysts and \nthe\u00a0users work together. However, design work is also being done because the \nactual detailed layout, including input and output data fields, is being devel-\noped. You might ask, \u201cIf the user interface is already designed, do I need to \n \nadd the view layer to the sequence diagram?\u201d The answer is a definite maybe. \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "418\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nOne advantage of adding it to the sequence diagram is that the programmer can \nsee how the view layer classes integrate with the rest of the design. It becomes \na check to make sure the design is correct and complete. It is a good practice to \nverify several use cases to ensure that the developers understand how the view \nlayer represents the user-interface design and how all the elements integrate \ntogether for a smooth program execution. Thus, input for view layer design \nincludes the use case description, the SSD, the activity diagrams, the first-cut \ndesign class diagram, and, finally, the user-interface layouts or mock-ups.\nUser-interface design and the integration of the view layer into a sequence \ndiagram are made even more complex by the fact that many systems require \nboth a Web-based interface and an internal, network-based interface. Fortu-\nnately, browsers are becoming more sophisticated, so many new systems can \nnow be designed for only one type of interface. Designing a system with multiple \nuser interfaces is a complex endeavor.\nLet\u2019s return to the Add customer account use case and add the view layer. \nRemember from the discussion of communication diagrams that there are three \ninput messages: createNewCustomer, enterAddress, and enterAccount. Let\u2019s \nassume that, from the results of our user-interface design, a separate input form \nfor each message is required. Let\u2019s add those classes to the sequence diagram. \nThe starting point is Figure 13-11, which is the sequence diagram with the prob-\nlem domain classes. The process to add the view layer is simply to add an object \nfor each input form or screen. First add the appropriate messages from the Clerk \nto the input \u00abview\u00bb objects. In this instance, the messages are the ones identified \nfrom the SSD, and which were used in Figure 13-11. Additional messages are \nadded for the :CustWindow to open the :AddrWindow, and the :AddrWindow \nto open the :AcctWindow. Figure 13-18 illustrates the resulting diagram with \nboth the domain and view layers.\nIn Figure 13-18, we just added a single view object for each message. This \napproach was rather straightforward. If we look at the other use case we have \nbeen using, Fill shopping cart, we have a more complex example. Remember \nthat the Fill shopping cart use case included other use cases for Search for item \nand View accessory combinations. Obviously, all those use cases go together \nfor a rich and efficient user experience. In Figure 13-19, we have added the \ntwo view layer objects for searching items and viewing accessories. The first \ninput message, addItem ( ), will go through the :SearchItemWindow object. \nIn other words, when the customer finds something he or she likes, he or she \nwill initiate adding it to his or her cart from that window. The message then \ncauses a detailed :AddItemWindow object to display and show the details to \nverify the addition to the cart. This later window will forward the message on \nto :CartHandler.\nOnce the item has been added to the cart, another window displays that \nshows the results of adding this new item. Depending on the design of the user \ninterface, this window might show the single newly added item or it might also \nshow the total shopping cart.\nThe next three view layer objects, :ViewAccessWindow, :AddAccess\u00ad\nWindow, and :DisplayItem+AccessWindow, function in a manner similar to the \nother view layer objects. The only difference is that the data includes the item \nand the accessories that have been added to the online cart.\nAdding the view layer to your design is a good way to verify that the user \ninterface that was developed with the users is consistent with the application \ndesign. All the input messages that were identified and documented on SSDs \nmust be handled by the user interface. If there are messages without input win-\ndows or windows without messages, you will know that part of the design is \nincomplete and that more definition is required.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

On large, complex systems, designers create \nthree-layer designs, including classes whose sole responsibility is executing data-\nbase SQL statements, getting the results of the query, and providing the informa-\ntion to the domain layer. As hardware and networks became more sophisticated, \nmultilayer design was used to support multitier networks in which the database \nserver was on one machine, the business logic was on another server, and the \nuser interface was on several desktop client machines. This way of designing \nsystems creates more robust and more flexible systems.\nIn most cases, problem domain classes are also persistent classes, which \nmeans that their data values must be stored by the system even when the appli-\ncation isn\u2019t executing. The whole purpose of a relational database is to provide \nthis ability to make problem domain objects persistent.

However, in object-oriented programming languages, the navigation \nis often in the opposite direction (i.e., the Customer class may have an array of \nreferences that point to the OnlineCart objects, which are in computer memory \nand are being processed by the system). In other words, design classes don\u2019t have \nforeign keys.\nThis chapter takes a somewhat simplified design approach in order to teach \nthe basic ideas without getting embroiled in the complexities of database access. \nLet us assume that every domain object has a table in a relational database. \n(More complex situations exist in which tables must be combined to provide the \ncorrect set of objects in memory.)\nWhen a new persistent object is created in memory, the constructor method \noften initiates the process to write it to the database. When an object is updated, \nit also needs to be written to the database. The common method to do that \nis simply to send a message to the data access object. Either the set of object \nattributes can be sent as parameters or simply as a reference to the object itself. \nThe data access method can pull out the attributes, format an SQL insert or \nupdate statement, and write it to the database.

There are several techniques (that pro-\nvide different designs) for linking the domain layer to the data access layer for \nreading data. There are two common techniques.\nOne technique is to have the constructor method of an object read the \ndatabase and obtain the required data to flesh out its attributes and create an \nobject in memory. For example, in the Fill shopping cart use case, we need to \nget the price from a PromoOffering object. This means that we first have to have \na PromoOffering object in memory, so it must be created and then accessed. \n\u00ad\nFigure\u00a013-21 illustrates this technique. The findPromo message invokes a con-\nstructor for :PromoOffering. During the instantiation, it reads the database to \nget the required data. Then, it can respond to the getPrice message.\nAnother technique is to send a message to the data access layer object and \nhave it read the database and then instantiate a new problem domain object. \nThis second technique is better when a set of objects needs to be created from a \ndatabase access that returns an unknown number of rows. However, both tech-\nniques are good solutions. Figure 13-22 illustrates this second technique.\n\u275a\n\u275aThe Data Access Layer for the Fill Shopping Cart Use Case\nFigure 13-23 is a portion of the Fill shopping cart use case from Figure 13-16. In \nthis diagram, we have only included the AddItem message to limit the complexity \nof the drawing. The data access classes have all been added along the top. The first \ntwo, :OnlineCartDA and :CartItemDA, are needed so that the system can write \nout the data from the newly created online cart and cart item. At the bottom of the \nlifeline of each of those two objects is the save statement, which causes the data to \nbe written to the database. The next three data access objects, :PromoOfferDA, \n:ProductDA, and :InventoryDA, are needed to retrieve data as part of the construc-\ntor for :PromoOffering, :ProductItem, and :InventoryItem. Each of those sets of \nmessages function as explained in Figure 13-21. As you can see, adding the data \naccess layer can increase the level of complexity of the drawing quite dramatically.\nIt is important during this process to ensure that source objects have navi-\ngation visibility to destination objects so messages can be sent. We assume but \ndon\u2019t show that the data access objects have global visibility.

{"text": "424\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nAn effective method for understanding what is going on in Figure 13-23 is \nto begin with the internal messages from the sequence diagram in Figure 13-17. \nLet us review each one and see what changes are required:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n[firstItem]createCart. The cart handler is going to send a message to a \ncustomer object to create a cart. First, it needs to ensure that there is \na customer object in memory. It sends a findCustomer message to the \naC:Customer object to find and create itself from the database. It does \nso by sending a message to the :CustomerDA object to read the database \nand return the appropriate customer object. Only then can it send the \ncreateCart message to aC:Customer. Also, note that at the end of this \nexecution, the aCrt:OnlineCart object sends a message to the data access \nobject to save the data to the database.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\naddItem. This message is initially the same in both figures. After \naCrt:CartItem has been created and populated with data, a message is sent \nto the data access object to save the data to the database.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\ngetPrice, getDesc, updateQty. These three messages all access or update the \ndatabase. Therefore, each also requires a previous message to find the appro-\npriate data from the database, which is stored in a domain object in memory.\nEven though Figure 13-23 appears rather crowded, looking at each internal \nmessage to a problem domain class makes the figure easier to understand. The \nprimary thing to remember is that data access objects are necessary to retrieve \ndata and thereby provide navigation visibility to the required object.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Updating and Packaging the Design Classes\nThe design class diagram keeps growing and expanding as each use case is \ndesigned and its methods added. The previous examples only created a design \nclass diagram for the problem domain classes. However, design class diagrams \ncan also be developed for each layer. In the view layer and the data access layer, \nseveral new classes must be specified. The domain layer also has new classes \nadded for the use case controllers.\nAs we update the design class diagram, note that there are three types of \nmethods found in most classes: (1) constructor methods, (2) data-get and data-\nset methods, and (3) use case\u2013specific methods.Constructor methods create new \ninstances of objects. Get and set methods retrieve and update attribute values. \nTo\u00a0avoid information overload, most developers don\u2019t include the get and set \nmethods in the DCD. The third type of method\u2014use case\u2013specific methods\u2014are \nthe ones we normally include in the design class diagram. Figure 13-24 contains \nthe completed design class diagram for the domain layer classes for the two use \ncases illustrated in this chapter, Create customer account and Fill shopping cart.\nThe two major additions to the domain layer classes are the two use case \nhandlers. Additional navigation arrows have also been added to document which \nclasses are visible from the controller classes. The other navigation arrows, \nwhich were defined during the first cut of the class diagram, have proved to be \nadequate for these two use cases.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Structuring the Major Components with Package Diagrams\nA package diagram in UML is simply a high-level diagram that allows design-\ners to associate classes of related groups. Designers sometimes need to docu-\nment differences or similarities in relationships in different layers\u2014perhaps \nseparating or grouping objects based on a distributed processing environment. \nThis information can be captured by showing each layer as a separate package. \n\u00ad\nFigure 13-25 illustrates how these layers might be documented.\nThe classes are placed inside the appropriate package based on the layer to which \nthey belong. To develop this package diagram, we simply extracted the information \nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

Dependency \nrelationships are used in package diagrams, class diagrams, and even interaction \ndiagrams. A good way to think about a dependency relationship is that if one \nelement changes (the independent element), the other (dependent) element might \nalso have to be changed. Dependency relationships can be between packages or \nbetween classes within packages. Figure 13-25 indicates that several classes in \nthe view layer are dependent on classes in the domain layer. Thus, for example, \nif a change is made in the ProductItem class, the SearchItemWindow class should \nbe evaluated to capture that change.

{"text": "427\nCHAPTER 13 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Use Case Realization\nUnfortunately, these same tools have propagated some bad programming \nhabits in some developers. The ease with which programmers can build GUI \nwindows and automatically insert code has allowed them to put all the code in \nthe windows. Each window component has several associated events where code \ncan be inserted. Thus, some programmers find it easy to build a window with \nan IDE tool, let the tool automatically generate the class definition, and merely \ninsert business logic code. No new classes need to be defined, and little other \ncoding is required. Some of these tools also have database engines, so the entire \nsystem can be built with windows classes. However, taking such shortcuts exacts \na price later.\nThe problem with this approach is the difficulty of maintaining the system. \nCode snippets scattered throughout the GUI classes are hard to find and main-\ntain. Plus, when the user-interface classes need to be upgraded, the program-\nmer must also find and update the business logic. If a network-based system \nneeds to be enhanced to include a Web front end, a programmer must rebuild \nnearly the entire system. Or if two user interfaces are desired, all the business \nlogic is programmed twice. Finally, without the tool that generates the code, it \nis almost impossible to keep the system current. This problem is exacerbated by \nnew releases of the IDE tools, which may not be compatible with earlier ver-\nsions. Many programmers have had to completely rewrite the front end of a \nsystem because the new release of an IDE tool didn\u2019t generate code the same way \nthe previous release did. Thus, we advise analysts and programmers to use good \ndesign principles in the development of new systems.\nBased on the design principle \u201cobject responsibility,\u201d it is possible to define \nwhich program responsibilities belong to each layer. If you follow these guide-\nlines when writing code, a system will be much easier to maintain throughout \nits lifetime. Let us summarize the primary responsibilities of each layer.\nView layer classes should have programming logic to perform the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDisplay electronic forms and reports.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCapture such input events as clicks, rollovers, and key entries.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDisplay data fields.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAccept input data.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEdit and validate input data.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nForward input data to the domain layer classes.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nStart and shut down the system.\nDomain layer classes should have responsibilities to perform the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCreate problem domain (persistent) classes.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nProcess all business rules with appropriate logic.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPrepare persistent classes for storage to the database.\nData access layer classes should have responsibilities to perform the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEstablish and maintain connections to the database.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nContain all SQL statements.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nProcess result sets (the results of SQL executions) into appropriate \ndomain objects.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nDisconnect gracefully from the database.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Design Patterns\nPatterns, also called templates, are used repeatedly in everyday life. A chef uses \na recipe, which is just another word for a pattern, to combine ingredients into a \nflavorful dish. A tailor uses a pattern to cut fabric for a great-fitting suit. Engi-\nneers take standard components and combine them into established configura-\ntions, or set patterns, to build buildings, sound systems, and thousands of other \nproducts.

The solution is general enough that it can be applied over and over \nagain. As time passes, the solution is documented and published, and eventually, \nit becomes accepted as the standard.\nStandard design templates have become popular among software developers \nbecause they can speed object-oriented design work. The formal name for these \ntemplates is design patterns. Design patterns became a widely accepted object-\noriented design technique in 1996 with the publication of Elements of Reusable \nObject-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, \nand John Vlissides. These four authors are now referred to as the Gang of Four \n(GoF). As you learn more about design patterns, you will often see references to \na particular design pattern as a GoF pattern. In their book, the authors identified \n23 basic design patterns. Today, scores of patterns have been defined\u2014from low-\nlevel programming patterns to midlevel architectural patterns to high-level enter-\nprise patterns. Two important enterprise platforms\u2014Java and .NET\u2014have sets \nof enterprise patterns, which are described in various books and publications.\nYou are also familiar with the concepts of design patterns and with two \nspecific patterns: three-layer design and use case controllers. Patterns exist at \nvarious levels of abstraction. At a concrete level, a pattern may be a class defini-\ntion that is written in code to be used by any developer. At the most abstract \nlevel, a pattern might only be an approach to solving a problem. For example, \nthe multilayer design pattern tends to be more abstract. Thus, multilayer design \nis an approach to building a system rather than a specific solution.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Use Case Controller\nIn Chapter 12, you were introduced to a design pattern called the Model-View-\nController pattern. Let us formalize the concept of a use case controller and \nexplain its importance as a design pattern. For any particular use case, messages \ncome from the external actor to a windows class (i.e., an electronic input form) \nand then to a problem domain class. This pattern answers the question of which \nproblem domain class should receive input messages to reduce coupling, main-\ntain highly cohesive domain classes, and maintain independence between the \nuser interface and the domain layer. Designers often define intermediary classes \nthat act as buffers between the user interface and the domain classes.\nFigure 13-26 provides a more formal specification for the use case control-\nler pattern. Note that this specification has five main elements:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nPattern name\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nProblem that requires a solution\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSolution to or explanation of the pattern\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nExample of the pattern\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nBenefits and consequences of the pattern\nA use case controller acts as a switchboard, taking input messages and routing \nthem to the correct domain class. In effect, the use case controller acts as an inter-\nmediary between the outside world and the internal system. The coupling between \nthe user-interface objects and the problem domain objects is reduced by making a \nsingle use case controller object to handle all the input messages. A use case con-\ntroller also contains logic that controls the flow of execution for the use case.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Adapter\nThe adapter pattern concept is straightforward. The adapter pattern is also a \ngood example of the design principles \u201cprotection from variations\u201d and \u201cindi-\nrection.\u201d An adapter pattern is roughly akin to an electrical adapter used for \ninternational travel. Thus, if you are traveling to England, you might decide to \ntake your hair dryer with you.

How can the coupling between the user-interface classes and\nthe domain classes be reduced?\nAssign the responsibility for receiving input messages to a class that receives\nall input messages and acts as a switchboard to forward them to the correct\ndomain class.

{"text": "430\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nThe adapter design pattern works just like the electrical adapter; it plugs \nan external component into an existing system. The method signatures on the \nexternal class are different from the method names being called from within the \nsystem, so the adapter class is inserted to convert the method calls from within \nthe system to the method names in the external class.\nFigure 13-28 describes the details of the adapter design pattern. The sample \ndiagram has four UML classes. The one labeled System represents the entire \nsystem. The classes within the system use such method names as getSTax() and \ngetUTax() to access the tax routines. The TaxCalculator class has the method \nnames findTax1() and findTax2(). The two UML classes in the middle represent \nthe adapter. The top middle class symbol represents an interface class. An inter-\nface is useful to specify the method names; although not absolutely necessary, it \nis a simple way to specify and enforce the use of the correct method names. The \nadapter class then inherits those method names and provides the method logic \nfor those methods. The body of each method simply extends a call to the final \nmethod name findTax1() or findTax2(). In other words, it \u201cadapts,\u201d or trans-\nlates, the method names from one to the other.\nAs you become familiar with this design pattern, you will find that it has a \nmultitude of uses. It is a powerful and elegant solution to making a system more \nmaintainable. Experienced developers use this pattern frequently\u2014for foreign \nclasses and for internally written classes that may need frequent upgrades. It is \nan excellent way to insulate the system from frequently changing classes.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Factory\nIn the discussions of detailed design, we have often expressed the need to have \nutility classes, which include the data access objects or controller classes. An \nadapter in an adapter pattern situation is also a utility class. What class should \ncreate these utility objects? In most situations, it doesn\u2019t make sense for domain \nclasses to create them because it isn\u2019t a listed responsibility of domain classes. \nA\u00a0popular solution in object-oriented programming is to have some classes that \nare factories. In other words, these classes instantiate objects from utility classes.\nFor example, an executing customer object may need to write some data. \nIf\u00a0the factory class is designed with static methods, which means they have \nglobal visibility, the customer object can just say to the factory: \u201cGet me a ref-\nerence to a data access object for the customer table.\u201d The factory will create \na new data access object and return the reference. If a customer data access \nobject already exists in memory, it simply returns the reference. The customer \nobject doesn\u2019t have to be concerned about creating objects to access the data-\nbase. It\u00a0just uses whatever is passed to it. This reduces coupling, enhances cohe-\nsion, and assigns responsibilities to the right classes. Figure 13-29 is an example \nof a factory class.\nThe factory class has private attributes to hold the references to the data \nobjects that are created. When a request is made to get the reference to a data \nobject, the method simply checks to see if the attribute is null. If so, it creates \na new object, places its reference in the attribute, and returns the value. Other-\nwise, it just returns the parameter with the reference already in it.\nFigure 13-27 Electrical adapter\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Usually, \nthese classes are service classes that manage a system resource, such as a data-\nbase connection. In fact, the factory class that was just described is an excellent \nexample.

{"text": "433\nCHAPTER 13 \u25a0 Object-Oriented Design: Use Case Realization\nNotice that the singleton pattern has the same basic logic as the factory \nmethod pattern. The difference is that the singleton class has code that applies to \nitself as static methods. The approach of the singleton solution is that the class has \na static variable that refers to the created object. A method such as getConnection \nis defined and used to get the reference to the object. The first time the getCon-\nnection method is called, it instantiates an object and returns a reference to it. On \nlater calls to the method, it simply returns a reference to the already instantiated \nobject. The code is simple and elegant. The example doesn\u2019t show the constructor; \nhowever, to ensure that only one instance is created, all constructors are specified \nas private\u2014not accessible\u2014so no other class can accidentally invoke one.\nIn the singleton template, the pattern is represented by code. To specify this \nin your design, you should stereotype the class as a \u00absingleton\u00bb. Good program-\nmers will recognize the stereotype and know exactly how to code the class.\nSingleton\nOnly one instantiation of a class is allowed. The instantiation (new) can be \ncalled from several places in the system. The first reference should make a\nnew instance, and later attempts should return a reference to the already\ninstantiated object. How do you define a class so that only one instance is \never created?\nA singleton class has a static variable that refers to the one instance of itself.\nAll constructors to the class are private and are accessed through a method\nor methods, such as getInstance(). The getInstance() method checks the variable;\nif it is null, the constructor is called. If it is not null, then only the reference to\nthe object is returned.\nIn RMO\u2019s system, the connection to the database is made through a class called\nConnection. However, for efficiency, we want each desktop system to open\nand connect to the database only once, and to do so as late as possible. Only\none instance of Connection\u2014that is, only one connection to the database\u2014is\ndesired. The Connection class is coded as a singleton. The following coding\nexample is similar to C# and Java:\nClass Connection\n{\nprivate static Connection conn = null;\npublic synchronized static getConnection ( )\n     {\n       if (conn == null) {\n conn = new Connection ( );}\n       return conn;\n     }\n}\nAnother example of a singleton pattern is a utilities class that provides services for the system,\nsuch as a factory pattern. Because the services are for the entire system, it causes confusion if\nmultiple classes provide the same services.\nAn additional example might be a class that plays audio clips. Since only one audio clip should\nbe played at one time, the audio clip manager will control that.\nmust be only one instance of the audio clip manager.\nThere are other times when only one instance of an object is needed, but if it is instantiated from\nonly one place, then a singleton may not be required. The singleton object controls itself\nand ensures that only one instance is created\u2014no matter how many times it is called and\nwherever the call occurs in the system.\nThe code to implement the singleton is very simple, which is one of the desirable characteristics\nof a good design pattern.\nBenefits and\nconsequences:\nExample:\nSolution:\nProblem:\nName:\nHowever, for this to work, there\nFigure 13-30 Singleton pattern technique\n\u00a9 Cengage Learning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

This \ninformation is used to update the design class diagram. \nChanges are also made to the design class diagram to \nshow required visibility between the classes in order to \nsend messages in the sequence diagrams. Package dia-\ngrams are used to partition the design class diagram into \nappropriate packages. Dependency between the classes \nand the packages is also added to the package diagram.\nPopular design patterns include the adapter pat-\ntern, factory pattern, singleton pattern, and observer \npattern. The adapter pattern implements the design \nprinciple \u201cprotection from variations\u201d by allowing a \nchanging piece of the system to simply plug into a more \nstable part of the system. When the pluggable piece of \nthe system needs to change, it can just be unplugged \nand the updated component can be plugged in.\nThe factory and singleton patterns have much in \ncommon. Both return a reference to a specific object. \nBoth allow only one instance of that object to exist in \nthe system. The difference is that the factory pattern \nenforces a single occurrence for utility classes and the \nsingleton only enforces a single occurrence for itself.\nDetailed design is use case\u2013driven in that each use case \nis designed separately. This type of design is called use \ncase realization. The two primary models used for \ndetailed design are the design class diagram and the \nsequence diagram.\nDetailed design of use cases entails identifying \nproblem domain classes that collaborate to carry out \na use case. Each input message from an external actor \ntriggers a set of internal messages. Using a sequence \ndiagram or a communication diagram, the designer \nidentifies and defines all these internal messages. In \nthe first cut, only the problem domain classes and \ntheir internal messages are identified. Next, the solu-\ntion is completed by adding the classes and messages \nfor the view layer and the data access layer.\nThree-layer design is part of the overall move-\nment in systems design based on design patterns. A \ndesign pattern is a standard solution or template that \nhas proven to be effective to a particular requirement \nin systems design.

The company acts as a \nclearinghouse for buyers and sellers of used books.\nTo offer books for sale, a person must register with \nMoveYourBooks. The person must provide a current physi-\ncal address and telephone number as well as a current \ne-mail address. The system maintains an open account for \nthis person. Access to the system as a seller is through a \nsecure, authenticated portal.\nA seller can list books on the system through a special \nInternet form. Information required includes all the perti-\nnent information about the book, its category, its general \ncondition, and the asking price. A seller may list as many \nbooks as desired. The system maintains an index of all \nbooks in the system so buyers can use the search engine \nto search for books. The search engine allows searches by \ntitle, author, category, and keyword.\nPeople who want to buy books come to the site and \nsearch for the books they want. When they decide to buy, \nthey must open an account with a credit card to pay for the \nbooks. The system maintains all this information on secure \nservers.\nWhen a request to purchase is made and the payment \nis sent, TheMoveYourBooks.com sends an e-mail notice \nto the seller of the book. It also marks the book as sold. \nThe\u00a0system maintains an open order until it receives notice \nthat the book has been shipped. After the seller receives \nnotice that a listed book has been sold, the seller must notify \nthe buyer via e-mail within 48 hours. Shipment of the order \nmust be made within 24 hours of the seller sending the noti-\nfication e-mail. The seller sends a notification to the buyer \nand \u00ad\nTheMoveYourBooks.com when the shipment is made.\nAfter receiving notice of shipment, TheMoveYour-\nBooks.com maintains the order in shipped status. At the \nend of each month, a check is mailed to each seller for the \nbook orders that have been in shipped status for 30\u00a0days. \nThe 30-day waiting period allows the buyer to notify The-\nMoveYourBooks.com if the shipment doesn\u2019t arrive for \nsome reason or if the book isn\u2019t in the same condition as \nadvertised.\nIf they want, buyers can enter a service code for \nthe seller. The service code is an indication of how well \nthe\u00a0seller is servicing book purchases. Some sellers are \nvery active and use TheMoveYourBooks.com as a major \noutlet for selling books.

{"text": "444\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Overview\nDeveloping any complex system is inherently difficult. For example, consider \nthe complexity of manufacturing automobiles. Tens of thousands of parts \nmust be fabricated or purchased. Laborers and machines must assemble those \nparts into small subcomponents, such as dashboard instruments, wiring har-\nnesses, and brake assemblies. These are in turn assembled into larger subcom-\nponents, such as instrument clusters, engines, and transmissions, which in \nturn must be constructed, tested, and passed on to subsequent assembly steps. \nOpening case\u2002 Tri-State Heating Oil: Juggling Priorities to Begin Operation\nIt was 8:30 on Monday morning, and Maria Grasso, \nKim Song, Dave Williams, and Rajiv Gupta were about \nto begin the weekly project status meeting. Tri-State \nHeating Oil had started developing a new schedul-\ning system for customer orders and service calls five \nmonths earlier. The target completion date was 10 \nweeks away, but the project was behind schedule. \nEarly project iterations had accomplished far less than \nanticipated because key users had disagreed on what \nnew system requirements to include and the system \nscope was larger than expected.\nMaria began the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019ve gained a day \nor two since our last meeting due to better-than-\nexpected unit testing results,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the meth-\nods developed last week sailed through unit testing, \nso we won\u2019t need any time this week to fix errors in \nthat code.\u201d\nKim frowned. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get too cocky just yet,\u201d \nshe said. \u201cAll the nasty surprises in my last project \ncame during integration testing. We\u2019re completing the \nuser-interface classes this week, so we should be able \nto start integration testing with the business classes \nsometime next week.\u201d\nNodding enthusiastically, Dave said: \u201cThat\u2019s good! \nWe have to finish testing those user-interface classes \nas quickly as possible because we\u2019re scheduled to \nstart user training in three weeks. I need that time to \ndevelop the documentation and training materials and \nwork out the final training schedule with the users.\u201d\nRajiv looked doubtful. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that we should \nbe trying to meet our original training schedule with so \nmuch of the system still under development,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWhat if integration testing shows major bugs that \nrequire more time to fix? And what about the unfin-\nished business and database classes? Can we\u00a0realisti-\ncally start training with a system that\u2019s little more than \na user interface with half a system behind it?\u201d\n\u201cBut we have to start training in three weeks,\u201d \nDave replied. \u201cWe contracted for a dozen temporary \nworkers so we could train our staff on the new sys-\ntem. Half of them are scheduled to start in two weeks \nand the rest two weeks after that. It\u2019s too late to \nrenegotiate their start dates. We can extend the time \nthey\u2019ll be here, but delaying their starting date means \nwe\u2019ll be paying for people we aren\u2019t using.\u201d\nMaria spoke up. \u201cI think that Rajiv\u2019s concerns are \nvalid,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic to start training in \nthree weeks with so little of the system completed \nand tested. We\u2019re at least five weeks behind sched-\nule, and there\u2019s no way we\u2019ll recapture more than four \nor five days of that during the next few weeks. I\u2019ve \nalready looked into rearranging some of the remaining \ncoding to give priority to the work most critical to user \ntraining. There are a few batch processes that can be \nput on the back burner for a while. Kim, can you rear-\nrange your testing plans to handle all the interactive \napplications first?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to go back to my office and take another \nlook at the dependencies among those programs,\u201d \nKim replied. \u201cOffhand, I\u2019d say yes, but I need a few \nhours to make sure.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Maria said. \u201cLet\u2019s proceed under the \nassumption that we can rearrange coding and testing \nto complete a usable system for training in five weeks. \nI\u2019ll confirm that by e-mail later today, as soon as Kim \ngets back to me. I\u2019ll also schedule a meeting with the \nCIO to deliver the bad news about temporary staffing \ncosts.\u201d\nAfter a few moments of silence, Rajiv asked, \u201cSo, \nwhat else do we need to be thinking about?\u201d\nWell, let\u2019s see,\u201d Maria replied. \u201cThere\u2019s hard-\nware delivery and setup, operating system and DBMS \ninstallation, importing data from the old database, the \nnetwork upgrade, and stress testing for the distributed \ndatabase accesses.\u201d\nRajiv smiled and said to Maria, \u201cYou must have \nbeen a juggler in your youth, which would have been \ngood practice for keeping all these project pieces up in \nthe air. Does management pay you by the ball?\u201d\nMaria chuckled. \u201cI do think of myself as a juggler \nsometimes.

{"text": "445\nCHAPTER 14 \u25a0 Deploying the New System\nThe effort, timeliness, cost, and output quality of each step depend on all the \npreceding\u00a0steps.\nImplementing and deploying an information system is similar in many ways; \nit is a complex production and assembly process that must use resources effi-\nciently, minimize construction time, and maximize product quality. But unlike \nautomobile manufacturing, it isn\u2019t done once and then used to build thousands \nof similar units. Instead, implementation and deployment are unique to each \nproject and must match that project\u2019s characteristics.\nWe have spent many chapters detailing the first four core processes of the \nsystem development life cycle (SDLC). This chapter covers the last two core \n\u00ad\nprocesses\u2014those related to implementing the system and deploying the system, \nas shown in Figure 14-1.\nThe fact that we are covering two core processes in a single chapter \ndoesn\u2019t mean that they are simple or unimportant. Rather, they are complex \nprocesses that you will learn about in detail by completing other courses and \nreading other books as well as through on-the-job training and experience. \nOur purpose in covering them in this chapter is to round out our discussion \nof the SDLC and to show how all the core processes and activities relate to \none another.\nImplementation activities are those related to building and testing the new \nsoftware, and to integrating all the components together. Earlier, you learned \nthat a new system may include purchased components, prebuilt components, \nnewly developed software components, DBMS components, and other middle-\nware components. All of these components must be tested in the total configura-\ntion of the new system. The fifth core process includes activities to complete all \nthese tasks.\nDeployment activities are related to final acceptance testing by the users of \nthe system, training the user, converting any existing data to the new DBMS \nstructure, configuring and testing the production computers and network, \ninstalling the new system, and turning it on.\nSometimes the dividing line between implementation and deployment is \nsomewhat fuzzy because testing of the new system occurs during both core pro-\ncesses. These two core processes can be distinguished by the primary focus of \neach. Implementation is focused toward building and testing the system by the \ntechnical project team. Deployment is focused toward putting the system into \nDeployment activities\nPerform system and stress tests.\nPerform user acceptance tests.\nConvert existing data.\nBuild training materials and conduct training.\nConfigure and set up production environment.\nDeploy the solution.\nImplementation activities\nProgram the software.\nUnit test the software.\nIdentify and build test cases.\nIntegrate and test components.\nCore\nprocesses\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nIdentify the problem and obtain\napproval.\nPlan and monitor the project.\nDiscover and understand details.\nDesign system components.\nBuild, test, and integrate system\ncomponents.\nComplete system tests and deploy\nthe solution.\nIterations\nFigure 14-1 Core processes with implementation and deployment activities\n\u00a9 CengageLearning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Because testing is such an integrated \nactivity across both core processes, this chapter begins with a discussion of \n\u00ad\nsoftware\u00a0testing.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Testing\nTesting activities are a key part of implementation and deployment activi-\nties, although different kinds of tests are used in each core process. Testing is \nthe process of examining a component, subsystem, or system to determine its \noperational characteristics and whether it contains any defects. To conduct a \ntest, developers must have well-defined specifications for both functional and \nnonfunctional requirements. From the requirements specifications, test devel-\nopers develop precise definitions of expected operational characteristics. The \ndevelopers can test software by designing and building the software, \u00ad\nexercising \nits function, and examining the results. If the results indicate a shortcom-\ning or defect, then the project team cycles back through earlier implementa-\ntion or deployment activities until the shortcoming is remedied or the defect \n \nis eliminated.\nTest types, their related core processes, and the defects they detect and oper-\national characteristics they measure are summarized in Figure 14-2. Each type \nof testing is described in detail later in this section.\nAn important part of developing tests is specifying test cases and data. \nA\u00a0test case is a formal description of the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nA starting state or condition\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nOne or more events to which the software must respond\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nThe expected response or ending state\nThe starting and ending states and the events are represented by a set \nof test data. For example, the starting state of a system may represent a \nFigure 14-2 Types of software tests and the purpose of each\ntest case\u2003 a formal description of a start-\ning state, one or more events to which the \nsoftware must respond, and the expected \nresponse or ending state\ntest data\u2003 a set of starting states and \nevents used to test a module, group of \nmodules, or entire system\nTest type\nCore process\nNeed and purpose\nUnit testing\nIntegration testing\nImplementation\nSoftware components must perform to the defned requirements and\nspecifcations when tested in isolation\u2014for example, a component that\nincorrectly calculates sales tax amounts in different locations is unacceptable.\nImplementation\nSoftware components that perform correctly in isolation must also perform\ncorrectly when executed in combination with other components.

The event may be represented by a set of input data \nitems, such as a customer account number and order number used to query \norder status. The expected response may be a described behavior, such as the \ndisplay of certain information, or a specific state of stored data, such as a \ncanceled order.\nPreparing test cases and data is a tedious and time-consuming process. \nAt\u00a0the component and method levels, every instruction must be executed at least \nonce. Ensuring that all instructions are executed during testing is a complex \nproblem. Fortunately, automated tools based on proven mathematical tech-\nniques are available to generate a complete set of test cases. Many test cases \nrepresenting normal and exceptional processing situations should be prepared \nfor each scenario.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Unit Testing\nUnit testing is the lowest level of and the earliest testing for a new software \n\u00ad\nsystem. The concept and approach to unit testing is not consistent across all \ndevelopment teams and, in fact, it has changed over the years as program-\nming methods and languages have changed. In today\u2019s object-oriented devel-\nopment approaches, a unit can be defined to be something as small as an \nindividual method. \u00ad\nHowever, a frequent definition is to define a unit as a \nclass or sometimes even a small set of closely integrated classes such as a \ncomponent. For our purposes, we define unit\u00a0test as a test of an individual \nmethod, class, or component before it is integrated with other software. The \nprimary purpose of doing unit testing is to test a small piece of the code in \nisolation to make sure that it functions correctly before it is integrated into a \nlarger program. Stated another way, its purpose is to make sure that the unit \nis error-free before being integrated into the larger program. There are three \nprimary characteristics of a unit test:\n1.\t It is done in isolation.\n2.\t The test data and the test are done by the programmer who wrote  \nthe code.\n3.\t It is done quickly without a large requirement for other resources.\nThe first requirement is that the unit test be done in isolation. The objec-\ntive of a unit test is to test a specific piece of software, and to be able to easily \nidentify the misbehaving code when an error occurs. If the unit is too large, or \nif it is not isolated, the error could come from some code or an interface other \nthan the specific code being tested. One of the difficulties of being able to iso-\nlate the unit being tested is that it often will depend on other software, either to \nreceive a parameter or to output a result. Figure 14-3 illustrates this condition. \nSuppose the piece of software is the colored box and the drawing on the left \ndescribes the location of the unit within a larger component. As can be seen, \nthe unit to be tested is called from and receives input parameters from another \ncomponent, and it passes output to two other components. A true unit test \nwould need to be configured as shown in the drawing on the right. A driver \nand a stub may need to be written and used to test the unit. In this example, \nthe stubs are overlapped to indicate that a single stub class could be used to \nreceive all unit test results.\nThe second requirement is that pieces of code are tested by the program-\nmer who writes the code. This is the fastest and easiest approach to unit test-\ning. The programmer writing the code can quickly generate test data and run \nseveral tests on the class or method. In addition, this requirement is in place \ndriver\u2003 a method or class used in unit \ntesting that simulates the behavior of a class \nthat calls and sends parameters to the unit \nbeing tested\nunit test\u2003 test of an individual method, \nclass, or component before it is integrated \nwith other software\nstub\u2003 a method or class used in unit testing \nthat receives and displays the output from the \nunit being tested\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

It \nis just human nature that if you are not accountable for your work, the qual-\nity degrades substantially. On highly productive development teams, program-\nmers are well trained on how to conduct unit tests. For example, one caveat is \nthat both good test data and bad test data should be used in the unit test. The \nnatural tendency is to just use good test data and observe the expected result. \nHowever, a well-trained programmer also thinks of multiple ways that bad data \nmight be received, either from user input or other errors.\nFinally, unit testing should not require elaborate test cases or complex tex-\nting configurations. Depending on the environment and the language being \nused, there are also unit test generators that can be used. The test driver and test \nstub, as shown in the previous figure, can often be written as general purpose \nand can be used to test many different pieces of code. One of the characteris-\ntics of a good unit test is that it can be done quickly and frequently without \nsetting up an entire testing environment. Unit testing should enhance the pro-\ngrammer\u2019s productivity, not consume a lot of resources\u2014neither programmer \ntime nor computing resources. Ideally, in an iterative development project where \nthe philosophy is that the system is developed organically, software methods or \nclasses can be written, unit tested, and quickly integrated into the new system as \nit gradually \u201cgrows.\u201d\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Integration Testing\nIntegration testing is the next logical extension of unit testing. After small units \nare tested, they are combined into a larger component and tested together. \nThe objective of integration testing is both to test the interfaces between these \nunits and to test the entire integrated piece of software. An integration test \nevaluates the functional behavior of a group of classes or components when \nthey are combined together. Figure 14-4 illustrates this concept\u2014a new class \nor component is integrated into the existing, growing, and tested portion of \nthe system.\nThe purpose of an integration test is to identify errors that weren\u2019t or \ncouldn\u2019t be detected by unit testing. There are two types of results that can \nbe tested. The first type of test is to test the interface itself between the \n\u00ad\ncomponents. Such errors may result from a number of problems, including \nthe following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nInterface incompatibility. For example, one method passes a parameter of \nthe wrong data type to another method.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nParameter values. A method is passed or returns a value that was unex-\npected, such as a negative number for a price.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUnexpected state interactions. The states of two or more objects interact to \ncause complex failures, as when an OnlineCart class method operates cor-\nrectly for all possible Customer object states except one.\nDriver\nStub\nFigure 14-3 Unit testing using drivers and stubs\nintegration test\u2003 test of the functional \nbehavior of a group of classes or components \nwhen they are combined together\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Again, both \ngood data and bad data should be used for the test. Good input data should produce \nthe correct expected result. Bad data should be captured and handled appropriately.\nIntegration testing often begins small, with an individual programmer com-\nbining the classes that she has developed into a larger component and tested. \nHowever, it soon grows to required components developed by different pro-\ngrammers to be combined and tested together. Consequently, the complexity of \nintegration testing increases rapidly. When integration testing reaches this level, \nseveral procedures must be put in place:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nBuilding the component for integration test. Sometimes, particularly when \nthe software is growing organically, this may be a natural result of adding \nnew components. At other times, particular integrated components need to \nbe built and tested separately.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCreating test data. Integration test data is more complex and usually \nrequires coordination between programmers. Responsibility for coordinat-\ning the creation, formatting, recording, use, and updating of the test data \nmust be assigned.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nConducting the integration test. Decisions must be made and assignments \ngiven about who will conduct the integration tests, how they are done, \nwhat resources are used, and how frequently they are executed.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEvaluating the results. Often this requires involvement by all the \nprogrammers.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nLogging test results. An error log is usually kept at this point to ensure that \nerrors are tracked and corrected.

Normally, the programmer who wrote \nthe original code makes the corrections, conducts any required unit tests, \nand submits the components back for integration testing. The person con-\nducting the integration test usually attempts to identify and isolate the \ncause of the error as much as possible.\nIntegration testing of object-oriented software is quite complex. Because an \nobject-oriented program consists of a set of interacting objects that can be cre-\nated or destroyed during execution, there is often no clear hierarchical structure. \nAs a result, object interactions and control flow are dynamic and complex.\nAdditional factors that complicate object-oriented integration testing include \nthe following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMethods can be (and usually are) called by many other methods, and the \ncalling methods may be distributed across many classes.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nClasses may inherit methods and state variables from other classes.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nThe specific method to be called is dynamically determined at run time \nbased on the number and type of message parameters.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nObjects can retain internal variable values (i.e., the object state) between \ncalls.

Integration testing is normally associated \nwith the implementation core process, and system testing is normally associ-\nated with the deployment core process. System testing often is used to verify the \nnonfunctional requirements, such as response time and throughput. The line \nseparating integration testing from system testing is fuzzy, as is the line between \nimplementation and deployment activities. The important differences are scope \nand timing. Integration tests are performed more frequently and on smaller com-\nponent groups. System tests are performed less frequently on entire systems or \nsubsystems. In addition, there are various kinds of system tests that test various \nfunctional and nonfunctional aspects of the new system.

{"text": "451\nCHAPTER 14 \u25a0 Deploying the New System\nsystem testing activities are often performed at the end of each iteration where \nsoftware is completed. Even with systems that are grown organically, there are \nusually natural plateaus where a subsystem is completed and delivered. System \ntests are performed on each of these subsystems as they become ready.\nSystem testing may also be performed more frequently. A build and smoke \ntest is a system test that is typically performed daily or several times per week. \nThe system is completely compiled and linked (built), and a battery of tests is \nexecuted to see whether anything malfunctions in an obvious way (\u201csmokes\u201d).\nBuild and smoke tests are valuable because they provide rapid feedback on \nsignificant integration problems. Any problem that occurs during a build and \nsmoke test must result from software modified or added since the previous test. \nDaily testing ensures that errors are found quickly and that they can be easily \ntracked to their sources. Less-frequent testing provides rapidly diminishing ben-\nefits because more software has changed and errors are more difficult to track \nto their sources.\nA performance test, also called a stress test, determines whether a sys-\ntem or subsystem can meet such time-based performance criteria as response \ntime or throughput. Response time requirements specify desired or maxi-\nmum allowable time limits for software responses to queries and updates. \n\u00ad\nThroughput requirements specify the desired or minimum number of queries \nand transactions that must be processed per minute or hour.\nPerformance tests are complex because they can involve multiple programs, \nsubsystems, computer systems, and network infrastructure. They require a large \nsuite of test data to simulate system operation under normal or maximum load. \nDiagnosing and correcting performance test failures are also complex. Bottle-\nnecks and underperforming components must first be identified. Corrective \nactions may include any combination of the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nApplication software tuning or reimplementation\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHardware, system software, or network reconfiguration\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUpgrade or replacement of underperforming components\n\u25a0\n\u25a0User Acceptance Testing (UAT)\nA user acceptance test (UAT) is comprehensive system testing to determine \nwhether the system fulfills user requirements and can support all business \nand user scenarios. The UAT is normally the final stage in testing the system. \nAlthough the primary focus is usually on the functional requirements, the non-\nfunctional requirements are often also verified.\nIn some cases, UAT is a formal milestone, and requires completion and sign-\noff by the client. Details of acceptance tests may even be included in a request for \nproposal (RFP) and procurement contract when a new system is built by or pur-\nchased from an external party. In those situations, payments to the developers \nare often tied to passing specific acceptance tests. In other situations, particu-\nlarly in Agile projects where the user is involved with the project team, UAT may \nbe less formal and may be integrated into the normal development activities.\nIn either situation, whether UAT is a formalized process or an informal \ncomponent of the development, it is a critical component of the development \nproject. All too often, because the project is behind and the delivery date is fast \napproaching, UAT is minimized or partially skipped. However, minimizing the \nUAT is always a mistake and a source of problems and disagreements. It is the \nUAT that verifies that the system is ready to be deployed. If the UAT is mini-\nmized or skipped, then it is almost a certainty that the deployed system will have \nmajor problems. As mentioned in Chapter 11, the Affordable Care Act insur-\nance Web site is a very visible example. It was deployed with very little UAT, and \nit took several months before it was ready.

{"text": "452\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nUAT is a big topic, larger than can be covered in this chapter. There are \nmany resources and instruction books on how to plan and execute a successful \nUAT. You are invited to do further study into this topic. The following sections \nbriefly discuss three areas\u2014planning, preparation, and execution of the UAT.\n\u275a\n\u275aPlanning the Uat\nThe UAT should be included in the total project plan, and whether it will be \nincluded in specific iterations or have its own iterations toward the end of the \nproject. Detailed plans for the UAT itself need to be developed early. There are \nimportant decisions and preparations that must be done throughout the proj-\nect. Waiting until late in the project to plan the UAT causes serious difficulties \nand delays.\nIn Chapters 2 and 3, you learned about business events, user stories, and \nuse cases. You also learned about functional and nonfunctional requirements. \nAll of these items created requirements and specifications. The UAT should be \nprepared to test all of them. Test cases should be identified to test various busi-\nness events, including external events (from the users), temporal events (such as \nmonth-end and year-end processing and reporting), and state events (such as \ninventory order points triggered). You also learned about FURPS+ as a basis \nfor defining specifications. The test plan should address each of these areas and \ndefine appropriate test cases to verify the fulfillment of the specification.\nThe important point here is that as user stories are identified, as use cases \nare defined, and as nonfunctional requirements are documented, UAT test \ncases can be identified that will enable the verification of the specifications. In \nother words, developing the details of what is to be included in the UAT occurs \nthroughout the project. The UAT test plan begins early and continues through-\nout the project. As each requirement is specified, the following question should \nbe asked: \u201cHow can the UAT test that this specification is complete?\u201d\nA frequent complaint by developers is that this is a lot of work. The answer is \ntwofold. A simple test identification list can be created and maintained through-\nout the project. Figure 14-7 illustrates a possible form. Notice that at this point \nin the project, it is a fairly simple list that is easily updated as the developers \nidentify requirements. The second part of the answer is, \u201cWhat is the alter-\nnative?\u201d If there is no documentation for what needs to be tested, it is\u00a0almost \n\u00ad\nguaranteed that the system will have many, and possibly major, defects.\n\u275a\n\u275aPreparation and Pre-Uat Activities\nThe process of entering data into Figure 14-7 only identifies the potential test \ncases. The other part of the effort required is to develop the test data. Creating \ntest data can be complex and require substantial resources. There are two pri-\nmary types of test data: data entered by users and internal data residing in the \ndatabase. The data entered by users can be precisely defined and documented, \nor the users can be allowed to create ad hoc data based on the requirement to be \nFigure 14-7 Simple UAT test case list\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

It is more work to predefine the \nfields of data, but verification of expected results is easier.\nThe planning and creation of test data necessitates more detailed planning \nof the UAT. For example in Figure 14-7, the third specification to ship items can \nbe done with data already existing in the database, or it can use data created by \nearlier specifications. Hence, the planning of the sequence of tests will assist in \nthe development of the test data. Another example of required planning is the \ntesting of month-end and year-end processing. In both of those cases, there will \nneed to be appropriate detail in the database in order for the test to be meaning-\nful. The question arises whether that data needs to be created from scratch, or \nif the previous tests will create sufficient data. It should be evident that the cre-\nation of test data can be a large endeavor.\nAnother area of pre-UAT activity is to set up the test environment. Because one \nof the purposes of the UAT is to verify that the system will function in the day-to-\nday business environment, it is usually necessary to set up a separate test computer \nand environment that simulates the true business environment as much as possible. \nThis will include computers, networks, databases, operating systems, and so forth.\n\u275a\n\u275aManagement and Execution of the Uat\nOne of the important decisions is who will participate and who has responsibil-\nity for the UAT. Because the objective of the UAT is user acceptance, the system \nusers have primary responsibility. Ideally, system users will take full responsibil-\nity for identifying test cases, creating test data, and carrying out the UAT. Unfor-\ntunately, in many organizations, the users either are not prepared, do not have \nenough expertise, or do not have time from their regular responsibilities to take \nover the testing completely. The user should always have the final say whether a \ntest is successful and a requirement satisfied. However, it is not uncommon that \nsome project personnel are required to help plan, organize, and execute the tests.\nManaging the UAT is like a mini-project in and of itself. As mentioned, both \nusers and development personnel are part of the team. Specific tests need to be \nscheduled. The test data needs to be ready and in place. Specific users will have \nassignments to complete their tasks. At the conclusion of each test, the results must \nbe verified.

Deployment activities (see Figure 14-9) involve many conflicting constraints, \nincluding cost, the need to maintain positive customer relations, the need to sup-\nport employees, logistical complexity, and overall risk to the organization. User \nacceptance and other test types were described in the previous section. \u00ad\nMultiple \ntypes of tests are often performed concurrently because later project iterations \ntypically include implementation and deployment activities. The following sec-\ntions provide additional details about deployment activities other than testing.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Converting and Initializing Data\nAn operational system requires a fully populated database to support ongoing \nprocessing. For example, online order-entry and management functions of the \nRMO CSMS rely on stored information about products, promotions, customers, \nand previous orders. Developers must ensure that such information is present in \nthe database at the moment the subsystem becomes operational.\nData needed at system start-up can be obtained from these sources:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFiles or databases of a system being replaced\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nManual records\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFiles or databases from other systems in the organization\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUser feedback during normal system operation\n\u275a\n\u275aReusing Existing Databases\nMost new information systems replace or augment an existing manual or auto-\nmated system. In the simplest form of data conversion, the old system\u2019s database \nis used directly by the new system with little or no change to the database struc-\nture. Reusing an existing database is fairly common because of the difficulty \nand expense of creating new databases from scratch, especially when a single \ndatabase often supports multiple information systems, as in today\u2019s enterprise \nresource planning (ERP) systems.\nAlthough old databases are commonly reused in new or upgraded \u00ad\nsystems, \nsome changes to database content are usually required. Typical changes include \nadding new tables, adding new attributes, and modifying existing tables or \nattributes. Modern database management systems (DBMSs) usually allow data-\nbase administrators to modify the structure of a fully populated database. Such \n\u00ad\nsimple changes as adding new attributes or changing attribute types can be \n\u00ad\nperformed entirely by the DBMS.\n\u00a9 CengageLearning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "455\nCHAPTER 14 \u25a0 Deploying the New System\n\u275a\n\u275aReloading Databases\nMore complex changes to database structure may require creating an entirely new \ndatabase and copying and converting data from the old database to the new data-\nbase. Whenever possible, utility programs supplied with the DBMS are used to \ncopy and convert the data. In more complex conversions, implementation staff \nmust develop programs to perform the conversion and transfer some or all of the \ndata. The upper portion of Figure 14-10 shows both approaches. In either case, the \nold database can be discarded once the conversion and transfer process is complete.\nThe middle of Figure 14-10 shows a more complex approach that uses an \nexport utility, an import utility, and a temporary data store. This approach \nmight be employed when the source and target databases employ different data-\nbase technologies; no utility exists that can directly translate from one to the \nother, but a \u201cneutral\u201d format exists that can serve as a bridge.\nData from paper records can be entered by using the same programs being \n\u00ad\ndeveloped for the operational system. In that case, data-entry programs are usually \ndeveloped and tested as early as possible. Initial data entry can be structured as a user \ntraining exercise. For greater efficiency, data from paper records can also be scanned \ninto an optical character recognition program and then entered into the database by \nusing custom-developed conversion programs or a DBMS import utility.\nIn some cases, it may be possible to begin system operation with a partially \nor completely empty database. For example, a customer order-entry system need \nnot have existing customer information loaded into the database. Customer \ninformation could be added the first time a customer places an order, based on \na dialogue between a telephone order-entry clerk and the customer. Adding data \nas they are encountered reduces the complexity of data conversion but at the \nexpense of slower processing of initial transactions.\nOld\ndatabase\nCopy and\nconvert data\nDBMS\nimport\nutility\nDBMS\nimport\nutility\nNew\ndatabase\nDBMS\nexport\nutility\nTemporary\ndata store\nManual\ndata entry\nPaper\nrecords\nRelated\nsubsystem\ndatabase\nOptical\ncharacter\nrecognition\nTemporary\ndata store\nCopy and\nconvert data\nFigure 14-10 Complex data-conversion example\n\u00a9 CengageLearning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

End users are people who use the system from \nday to day to achieve the system\u2019s business purpose. System operators are people \nwho perform administrative functions and routine maintenance to keep the system \noperating. Figure 14-11 shows representative activities for each role. In smaller sys-\ntems, a single person may fill both roles. In larger organizations, the technical sup-\nport staff may already be prepared to handle the system operator responsibilities. In \nthat case, only some documentation or basic instructions may be all that is needed.\nThe nature of training varies with the target audience. Training for end \nusers must emphasize hands-on use for specific business processes or functions, \nsuch as order entry, inventory control, or accounting. If the users aren\u2019t already \nfamiliar with those procedures, training must include them. Widely varying skill \nand experience levels call for at least some hands-on training, including practice \nexercises, questions and answers, and one-on-one tutorials. Self-paced training \nmaterials can fill some of this need, but complex systems also require some face-\nto-face training. If there is a large number of end users, group training sessions \ncan be used, and a subset of well-qualified end users can be trained and then \npass their knowledge on to other users.\nDetermining the best time to begin formal training can be difficult. On one \nhand, users can be trained as parts of the system are developed and tested, which \nensures that they hit the ground running. On the other hand, starting early can \nbe frustrating to users and trainers because the system may not be stable or com-\nplete. End users can quickly become frustrated when using a buggy, crash-prone \nsystem with features and interfaces that are constantly changing.\nIn an ideal world, training doesn\u2019t begin until the interfaces are finalized and \na test version has been installed and fully debugged. But the typical end-of-proj-\nect crunch makes that approach a luxury that is often sacrificed. Instead, training \nmaterials are normally developed as soon as the interfaces are reasonably stable, \nand end-user training begins as soon as possible thereafter. It is much easier to \nprovide training if system interfaces are completed in early project iterations.\nDocumentation and other training materials are usually developed before \nformal user training begins. Each documentation type is targeted to a different \npurpose and audience. Documentation can be loosely classified into two types:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSystem documentation.

System documentation developed \nduring early project iterations guides activities in later iterations, and documen-\ntation developed throughout the SDLC guides future system maintenance and \nupgrades.\nA system deployed for a customer is a collection of computing and network \nhardware, system software, and application software. Once the system had been \ndeveloped, separate descriptions of it, such as written text and graphical mod-\nels, are redundant with the system itself. In the early days of computing, there \nwere few automated tools to support development of analysis and design models \nand even less support for automating the process of generating application soft-\nware from those models. Developers in that era faced a recurring dilemma: how \nto minimize the duplicate effort of updating models and application software \nwhile ensuring that the system documentation was always \u201cin sync\u201d with the \nactual system. In the rush to complete and deploy systems and to maintain and \nupgrade them over time, system documentation updates were often neglected \nand documentation was frequently lost.\nModern application development tools and methods have largely solved the \nsystem documentation dilemma of earlier times. A modern integrated develop-\nment environment provides automated tools to support all SDLC core processes. \nRequirements and design models, such as use case descriptions, class diagrams, \nand sequence diagrams, are developed by using the development tool and stored \nin a project library (see Figure 14-12). Changes to one model are automatically \nsynchronized with related models. Application software is often generated in \npart or in its entirety directly from design models. When application software \nis altered at a later date, the development tools can \u201creverse engineer\u201d appropri-\nate changes to the models. Due to these capabilities, system documentation is \nalways complete and in sync with the deployed system, thus simplifying future \nmaintenance and upgrades.\n\u275a\n\u275aUser Documentation\nUser documentation provides ongoing support for end users of the system. It \nprimarily describes routine operation of the system, including such functions as \nFigure 14-12 System documentation stored within Microsoft Visual Studio\nSource: Microsoft Corporation\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

Development takes time, and high-\nquality results are achieved only with thorough review and testing. Unfortu-\nnately, preparing user documentation is often left to technicians lacking in one \nor more necessary skills. Also, preparation time, review, and testing are often \nshortchanged because of schedule overruns and the last-minute rush to tie up all \nthe loose ends of implementation.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Configuring the Production Environment\nModern applications are built from software components based on interaction \nstandards, such as Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), \nSimple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and Java Platform Enterprise Edition \n(Java EE). Each standard defines specific ways in which components locate and \ncommunicate with one another.

{"text": "460\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\nUnless it already exists, all this hardware and system software infrastruc-\nture must be acquired, installed, and configured before application software \ncan be installed and tested. In most cases, some or all of the infrastructure will \nalready exist\u2014to support existing information systems. In that case, developers \nwork closely with personnel who administer the existing infrastructure to plan \nthe support for the new system. In either case, this deployment activity typically \nstarts early in the project so software components can be developed, tested, and \ndeployed as they are developed in later project iterations.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Managing Implementation, Testing,  \nand Deployment\nThe previous sections have discussed the implementation, testing, and deploy-\nment activities in isolation. This section concentrates on issues that impact all \nthose activities as well other core processes, including project planning and \nmonitoring, analysis, and design. In an iterative development project, activities \nfrom all core processes are integrated into each iteration and the system is ana-\nlyzed, designed, implemented, and deployed incrementally. But how does the \nproject manager decide which portions of the system will be worked in early \niterations and which in later iterations? And how does he or she manage the \ncomplexity of so many models, components, and tests?\nSome of these issues were partly addressed in earlier chapters. But now that \nyou understand implementation, testing, and deployment activities in depth, you \ncan see that there are many interdependencies that must be accounted for. These \ninterdependencies must be fully identified and considered when developing a \nworkable iteration plan. Furthermore, automated tools must be utilized to man-\nage each part of the development project and to ensure maximal coordination \nacross iterations, core processes, and activities.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Development Order\nOne of the most basic decisions to be made about developing a system is the \norder in which software components will be built or acquired, tested, and \ndeployed. Choosing which portions of the system to implement in which itera-\ntions is difficult, and developers must consider many factors, only some of which \narise from the software requirements. Some of the other factors discussed in ear-\nlier chapters include the need to validate requirements and design decisions and \nthe need to minimize project risk by resolving technical and other risks as early \nas possible.\nA development order can be based directly on the structure of the system \nitself and its related issues, such as use cases, testing, and efficient use of devel-\nopment staff. Several orders are possible, including the following:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nInput, process, output\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nTop-down\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nBottom-up\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nUse-case driven\nEach project must adapt one or a combination of these approaches to spe-\ncific project requirements and constraints.\n\u275a\n\u275aInput, Process, Output Development Order\nThe input, process, output (IPO) development order is based on data flow \nthrough a system or program.

The key issue to analyze is dependency\u2014that is, which classes \nand methods capture or generate data that are needed by other classes or meth-\nods? Dependency information is documented in package diagrams and may also \nbe documented in a class diagram. Thus, either or both diagram types can guide \nimplementation order decisions.\nFor example, the package diagram in Figure 14-15 shows that the Cus-\ntomer Account and Marketing subsystems don\u2019t depend on any of the other sub-\nsystems. The Sales subsystem depends on the Customer Account and Marketing \nsubsystems, and the Order Fulfillment and Reporting subsystems depend on the \nSales subsystem.\nThe chief advantage of the IPO development order is that it simplifies test-\ning. Because input programs and modules are developed first, they can be used \nto enter test data for process and output programs and modules. IPO develop-\nment order is also advantageous because important user interfaces (e.g., data-\nentry routines) are developed early. User interfaces are more likely to require \nchange during development than during other portions of the system, so early \ndevelopment allows for early testing and user evaluation. If changes are needed, \nthere is still plenty of time to make them. Early development of user interfaces \nalso provides a head start for related activities, such as training users and writ-\ning documentation.\nSearchItemWindow\nAddItemWindow\nAddAccessWindow\nCustLoginWindow\nSales Subsystem\nCartHandler\nOnlineCart\nCartItem\nReturnItem\nSale\nSaleItem\nAccessoryPackage\nSaleTxn\nData Access Layer\nPromoOfferingDA\nProductItemDA\nInventoryItemDA\nCustomerDA\nOnlineCartDA\nCartItemDA\nViewAccessWinodw\nDisplayItem+AccessWindow\nDisiplayItemWindow\nReporting Subsystem\nCustomer Account Subsystem\nCustomerHandler\nCustomer\nAddress\nFamilyLink\nMessage\nSuggestion\nAccount\nCustPartnerCredit\nOrder Fulfillment Subsystem\nShipment\nShipper\nView Layer\nDomain Layer\nProductItem\nInventoryItem\nPromoPartner\nPromotion\nPromoOffering\nMarketing Subsystem\nFigure 14-15 Package diagram for the four RMO subsystems\n\u00a9 CengageLearning\u00ae\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "462\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\n\u275a\n\u275aTop-Down and Bottom-Up Development Order\nThe terms top-down and bottom-up have their roots in traditional structured \ndesign and structured programming. A traditional structured design decom-\nposes software into a series of modules or functions, which are hierarchically \nrelated to one another. As a visual analogy, consider a typical organization chart \nwith the president or CEO at the top. In structured design, a single module (the \npresident or CEO) controls the entire software program. Modules at the bottom \nperform low-level specialized tasks when directed to do so by a module at the \nnext higher level. Top-down development begins with the CEO and works \ndownward. Bottom-up development begins with the detailed modules at the \nlowest level and works upward to the CEO.\nTop-down and bottom-up program development can also be applied to \nobject-oriented designs and programs, although a visual analogy isn\u2019t obvious \nwith object-oriented diagrams. The key issue is method dependency\u2014that is, \nwhich methods call which other methods. Within an object-oriented subsystem \nor class, method dependency can be examined in terms of navigation visibility, \nas discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.\nThe primary advantage of top-down development is that there is always a \nworking version of a program. As each method or class is implemented, stubs \nfor the methods or classes on the next lower level are added. At every stage of \ndevelopment, the program can be executed and tested, and its behavior becomes \nmore complex and realistic as development proceeds.\n\u275a\n\u275aUse-Case Driven\nIPO, top-down, and bottom-up development are only starting points for creat-\ning implementation and iteration plans. Other factors that must be considered \ninclude use-case-driven development, user feedback, training, documentation, \nand testing. Use cases deserve special attention in determining development \norder because they are one of the primary bases for dividing a development proj-\nect into iterations.\nIn most projects, developers choose a set of related use cases for a single \niteration and complete analysis, design, implementation, and deployment activi-\nties. Use-case-driven development occurs when developers choose which \nuse cases to focus on first based on such factors as minimizing project risk, \nefficiently using nontechnical staff, or deploying some parts of the system ear-\nlier than others. For example, use cases with uncertain requirements or high \ntechnical risks are typically addressed in early iterations. Addressing uncertain \nrequirements requires usability and other testing by nontechnical development \nstaff, and those staff members may only be available at certain times in the \nproject.\nUser feedback, training, and documentation all depend heavily on the user \ninterfaces of the system. Early implementation of user interfaces enables user \ntraining and the development of user documentation to begin early in the devel-\nopment process. It also gathers early feedback on the quality and usability of the \ninterface. Note the important role that this issue played in the opening case of \nthis chapter.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Source Code Control\nDevelopment teams need tools to help coordinate their programming tasks. \n \nA source code control system (SCCS) is an automated tool for tracking \nsource code files and controlling changes to those files.

When a programmer needs to make changes to a file, \nhe or she checks out the file in read/write mode. The SCCS allows only one pro-\ngrammer to check out a file in read/write mode. The file must be checked back \nin before another programmer can check it out in read/write mode.\nFigure 14-16 shows the source code control display of Microsoft Visual \nStudio. Various source code files from the RMO CSS are shown in the display. \nSome files are currently checked out by programmers. For each file checked out \nin read/write mode, the program lists the programmer who checked it out, the \ndate and time of checkout, and whether the copy currently stored in the central \nrepository is the most current (latest) version.\nAn SCCS prevents multiple programmers from updating the same file at the \nsame time, thus preventing inconsistent changes to the source code.

Both systems are concurrently oper-\nated for only a brief time (typically a few days or weeks) while the new system is \nbeing installed and tested.

Because the \nold and new systems aren\u2019t operated in parallel, there are fewer logistical issues \nto manage and fewer resources required. The primary disadvantage of direct \ndeployment is its risk. Because older systems aren\u2019t operated in parallel, there \nis no backup in the event that the new system fails. The magnitude of the risk \ndepends on the nature of the system, the cost of workarounds in the event of a \nsystem failure, and the cost of system unavailability or less-than-optimal system \nfunction.\n\u275a\n\u275aParallel Deployment\nIn a parallel deployment, the old and new systems are operated for an \nextended period of time (typically weeks or months). Figure 14-18 illustrates \nthe timeline for parallel deployment.

If both systems are operated completely (i.e., using all data and exercising \nall functions), the old system functions as a backup for the new system. Any fail-\nure in the new system can be mitigated by relying on the old system.\nThe primary disadvantage of parallel deployment is cost. During the period \nof parallel operation, the organization pays to operate both systems. Extra costs \nassociated with operating two systems in parallel include:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nHiring temporary personnel or temporarily reassigning existing personnel\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nAcquiring additional computing and network capacity\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nIncreasing managerial and logistical complexity\nParallel operation is generally best when the consequences of a system \u00ad\nfailure \nare severe. Parallel operation substantially reduces the risk of a system failure \nthrough redundant operation. The risk reduction is especially important for \n \nsuch mission-critical applications as customer service, production control, basic \naccounting functions, and most forms of online transaction processing.\nFull parallel operation may be impractical for any number of reasons, \nincluding:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nInputs to one system may be unusable by the other, and it may not be \n\u00ad\npossible to use both types of inputs.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nThe new system may use the same equipment as the old system (e.g., \n\u00ad\ncomputers, I/O devices, and networks), and capacity may be insufficient to \noperate both systems.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nStaffing levels may be insufficient to operate or manage both systems at the \nsame time.\nWhen full parallel operation isn\u2019t possible or feasible, a partial parallel \noperation may be employed instead. Possible modes of partial parallel operation \ninclude:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nProcessing only a subset of input data in one of the two systems.

For example, parallel operation with partial input \nincreases the risk that errors associated with untested inputs won\u2019t be discovered.\n\u275a\n\u275aPhased Deployment\nIn a phased deployment, the system is deployed in a series of steps or phases. \nEach phase adds components or functions to the operational system. During \neach phase, the system is tested to ensure that it is ready for the next phase. \nPhased deployment can be combined with parallel deployment, particularly \nwhen the new system will take over the operation of multiple existing systems.\nFigure 14-19 shows a phased deployment with direct and parallel deploy-\nment of individual phases. The new system replaces two existing systems. The \ndeployment is divided into three phases. The first phase is a direct replacement \nof one of the existing systems. The second and third phases are different parts of \na parallel deployment that replace the other existing system.\nThe primary advantage of phased deployment is reduced risk because fail-\nure of a single phase is less problematic than failure of an entire system. The \nprimary disadvantage of phased deployment is increased complexity. Dividing \nthe deployment into phases creates more activities and milestones, thus making \nthe entire process more complex.

{"text": "467\nCHAPTER 14 \u25a0 Deploying the New System\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Support Activities after Deployment\nThe predictive waterfall SDLC explicitly includes a support phase, but adaptive, \niterative SDLCs typically don\u2019t. In fact, newer adaptive SDLCs consider support \nto be an entirely separate project worthy of its own support methodology.\nThe objective of the support activities is to keep the system running pro-\nductively during the years following its initial deployment. They begin only \nafter the new system has been installed and put into production, and they last \nthroughout the productive life of the system. Most business systems are expected \nto last for years. During the support activities, upgrades or enhancements may \nbe carried out to expand the system\u2019s capabilities, and these will require their \nown development projects. Three major activities occur during support:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nMaintaining the system\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nEnhancing the system\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nSupporting the users\nEvery system, especially a new one, contains components that don\u2019t func-\ntion correctly. Software development is complex and difficult, so it is never free \nof error. Of course, the objective of a well-organized and carefully executed \nproject is to deliver a system that is robust and complete and that gives correct \nresults. However, because of the complexity of software and the impossibility of \ntesting every possible combination of processing requirements, there will always \nbe errors. In addition, business needs and user requirements change over time. \nKey tasks in maintaining the system include fixing the errors (also known as fix-\ning bugs) and making minor adjustments to processing requirements. Usually, a \nsystem support team is assigned responsibility for maintaining the system.\nMost newly hired programmer analysts begin their careers working on sys-\ntem maintenance projects. Tasks typically include changing the information \nprovided in a report, adding an attribute to a table in a database, or chang-\ning the design of Windows or browser forms. These changes are requested and \napproved before the work is assigned, so a change request approval process is \nalways part of the system support phase.\nDuring the productive life of a system, it is also common to make major mod-\nifications. At times, government regulations require new data to be maintained \nor information to be provided. Also, changes in the business environment\u2014new \nmarket opportunities, new competition, or new system infrastructure\u2014neces-\nsitate major changes to the system. To implement these major modifications, \nthe company must approve and initiate an upgrade development project. An \nupgrade project often results in a new version of the system. During your career, \nyou may participate in several upgrade projects.\nThe next section describes the techniques used during the support activities \nto maintain the system. These techniques apply to the final testing and deploy-\nment activities as well as to the system after it is in production.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Change and Version Control\nThough not formal activities of the implementation or deployment core pro-\ncesses, change and version control are key parts of managing software devel-\nopment, testing, deployment, and support activities. Medium- and large-scale \nsystems are complex and constantly changing. Changes occur rapidly during \nimplementation and more slowly during deployment and after the system is in \nuse. System complexity and rapid change create a host of management problems, \nparticularly for testing and postdeployment support.\nChange and version control tools and processes handle the complexity asso-\nciated with testing and supporting a system through multiple versions. Tools \nand processes are typically incorporated into implementation activities from the \nbeginning and continue throughout the life of a system. Most organizations use \na common set of tools and procedures for all their systems.\nsupport activities\u2003 the activities in the \nsupport phase whose objective is to maintain \nand enhance the system after it is installed \nand in use\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

{"text": "468\nPART 5 \u25a0 Advanced Design and Deployment Concepts\n\u275a\n\u275aVersioning\nComplex systems are developed, installed, and maintained in a series of versions \nto simplify testing, deployment, and support. It isn\u2019t unusual to have multiple \nversions of a system deployed to end users and yet more versions in different \nstages of development. A system version created during development is called a \ntest version. A test version contains a well-defined set of features and represents \na concrete step toward final completion of the system. Test versions provide a \nstatic system snapshot and a checkpoint to evaluate the project\u2019s progress.\nAn alpha version is a test version that is incomplete but ready for some \nlevel of rigorous integration or usability testing. Multiple alpha versions may \nbe built depending on the size and complexity of the system. The lifetime of an \nalpha version is typically short\u2014days or weeks.\nA beta version is a test version that is stable enough to be tested by end \nusers over an extended period of time. A beta version is produced after one or \nmore alpha versions have been tested and known problems have been corrected. \nEnd users test beta versions by using them to do real work. Thus, beta versions \nmust be more complete and less prone to disastrous failures than alpha versions. \nBeta versions are typically tested over a period of weeks or months.\nA system version created for long-term release to users is called a \u00ad\nproduction \nversion, release version, or production release. A production version \nis considered a final product, although software systems are rarely \u201cfinished\u201d \nin the usual sense of that term. Minor production releases (sometimes called \n\u00ad\nmaintenance releases) provide bug fixes and small changes to existing fea-\ntures. Major production releases add significant new functionality and may be \nthe result of rewriting an older release from the ground up.\nKeeping track of versions is complex. The development teams must coordinate \nexisting production versions with its upgrades with new versions. \u00ad\nFigure\u00a014\u201320 \nillustrates some of the overlap that occurs and must be coordinated. Each version \nneeds to be uniquely identified for developers, testers, and users. In applications \ndesigned to run under Windows, users typically view the version information by \nchoosing the About item from the standard Help menu (see Figure 14-21). Users \nseeking support or reporting errors in a beta or production version use this fea-\nture to report the system version to testers or support personnel.\nControlling multiple versions of the same system requires sophisticated \nversion control software, which is often built in to development tools or can \nbe obtained through a separate source code and version control system, as \ndescribed later in this chapter. Programmers and support personnel can extract \nthe current version or any previous version for execution, testing, or modi\u00ad\nfication. Modifications are saved under a new version number to protect the \naccuracy of the historical snapshot.\nBeta and production versions must be stored as long as they are installed \non any servers or user machines. Stored versions are used to evaluate future bug \nreports. For example, when a user reports a bug in version 1.0, support person-\nnel extract that release from the archive and attempt to replicate the user\u2019s error. \nFeedback provided to the user is specific to version 1.0, even if the most recent \nproduction release is a higher-numbered version.\n\u275a\n\u275aSubmitting Error Reports and Change Requests\nTo manage the risks associated with change, most organizations adopt \u00ad\nformal \ncontrol procedures for all systems under development and in operation. For-\nmal controls are designed to ensure that potential changes are adequately \ndescribed, considered, and planned before being implemented and deployed. \nTypical change control procedures include these:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nStandard reporting methods\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nReview of requests by a project manager or change control committee\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFor operational systems, extensive planning for design and implementation\nalpha version\u2003 a test version that is incom-\nplete but ready for some level of rigorous \nintegration or usability testing\nbeta version\u2003 a test version that is stable \nenough to be tested by end users over an \nextended period of time\nproduction version, release version, or \nproduction release\u2003 a system version \nthat is formally distributed to users or made \noperational for long-term use\nmaintenance release\u2003 a system update \nthat provides bug fixes and small changes to \nexisting features\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

This section gives you a glimpse of the inter-\nplay among those issues by showing how Barbara Halifax\u2019s team developed an \niteration plan for RMO\u2019s Customer Support System (CSS). But keep in mind that \nno single example can adequately prepare you to tackle iteration planning for \na complex project. That is why iteration planning and other project planning \ntasks are typically performed by developers with years of experience.\nBefore reading the rest of this section, you may want to review earlier \ndescriptions of the RMO case in Chapters 2, 3, 4, 6, and 11. Some basic param-\neters for the project are already described, including subsystem boundaries and \na 48-week project length (nine 4-week iterations).\nChapter 11 describes Barbara\u2019s early planning decisions. In this section, \nshe expands on those decisions, makes some changes to her earlier decisions, \nmakes additional key decisions, and develops the revised iteration plan shown \nin \u00ad\nFigure\u00a014-23. The sections that follow describe key issues and decisions that \nunderlie that plan.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Upgrade or Replace?\nUpgrading the current CSS \u201cin place\u201d was ruled out early in project planning \nfor these reasons:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nThe current infrastructure is near capacity.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nRMO expects to save money by having an external vendor host the CSMS.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nExisting CSS programs and Web interfaces are a hodgepodge developed \nover 15 years.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nCurrent system software is several versions out of date.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nInfrastructure that supports the current CSS can be repurposed to expand \nSCM capacity.\nIn short, it would be too complex to upgrade the current CSS without dis-\nrupting operations, and the risks of upgrading old infrastructure and applica-\ntion software are simply too great. By building and deploying an entirely new \nsystem, RMO will make a clean break from the existing CSS and its supporting \ninfrastructure.

Thus, a new \nCSMS database will need to be built, and data will need to be migrated from the \nCSS database prior to deploying version 1.0.\nDatabase development and migration prior to version 1.0 deployment will \noccur over multiple iterations. The iteration plan calls for creating a copy of the \nCSS database early in the project and making incremental changes to it. All data \nin the production CSS database will be migrated to the CSMS database near the \nend of the fourth iteration. If problems are encountered, they will be resolved \nand the migration will be repeated as early as possible during the fifth iteration. \nMigrating much of the data during the fourth iteration will enable fifth-iteration \ntesting of user interfaces with real data from real customers and products and \nsystem and stress testing with a \u201cproduction sized\u201d database.\nAt the end of the fifth iteration, all CSS database changes since the last \nfull migration will be copied to the CSMS database. Copying only the changes \nwill enable migration within a matter of hours. The CSS system will be offline \nduring the migration. Cutover to the CSMS will occur as soon as the migration \nis completed. To minimize risk, additional data conversion routines will copy \nnew data from the CSMS database back to the CSS database twice per day \nduring the fifth iteration. If disaster strikes, the CSS can be restarted with a \ncurrent and complete database. If CSMS version 1.0 passes all user acceptance \ntests during the fifth iteration, the CSS will be turned off and data migration \nwill\u00a0cease.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Development Order\nA combination of IPO and use-case-driven development order is the primary \nbasis for the development plan. By starting with a copy of the CSS database, a \nset of test data will exist from the first iteration, thus enabling the highest-risk \nuse cases to be tackled first. These involve the entire Sales subsystem and cus-\ntomer-facing portions of the Order Fulfillment subsystem. The risks arise from \nnew technology, uncertainty about requirements, and the operational impor-\ntance of sales and order fulfillment to RMO. By tackling those use cases first, \nBarbara allowed her development staff plenty of time to resolve uncertainties \nand test related software. Note that significant testing of these functions began \nin iteration 2 and continued through most of the project.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0Documentation and Training\nTraining activities were spread throughout later project iterations for both pro-\nduction versions. Initial training exercises covered the highest-risk portion of \nthe system prior to deployment. They also enabled developers to do integration \nand performance testing on the sales-related use cases long before deployment. \n\u00ad\nAdditional training continued as new functions were added to the system, pro-\nviding a gradual ramping up of user skills and developer workload.\nCopyright 2016 Cengage Learning.

HudsonBanc decided that \na new component-based, Web-oriented system should be \nbuilt or purchased. Management preferred the purchase \noption because it was assumed that a purchased system \ncould be brought online more quickly and cheaply. An RFP \n(request for proposal) was prepared, many responses were \nreceived, and after months of business modeling and re-\nquirements activities, a vendor was chosen.\nHardware for the new system was installed in early \nJanuary. Software was installed the following week, \nand a random sample of 10 percent of the customer ac-\ncounts was copied to the new system. The new system \nwas \u00ad\noperated in parallel with the old systems for two \nmonths. To save costs involved with complete duplication, \nthe new system computed but didn\u2019t actually print billing \nstatements. Payments were entered into both systems \nand used to update parallel customer account databases. \n\u00ad\nDuplicate account records were checked manually to en-\nsure that they were the same.\nAfter the second test billing cycle, the new system \nwas declared ready for operation. All customer accounts \nwere migrated to the new system in mid-April. The old sys-\ntems were turned off on May 1, and the new system took \nover operation. Problems occurred almost immediately. \nThe system was unable to handle the greatly increased \nvolume of transactions. Data entry and customer Web ac-\ncess slowed to a crawl, and payments were soon backed \nup by several weeks. The system wasn\u2019t handling certain \ntypes of transactions correctly (e.g., charge corrections and \ncredits for overpayment). Manual inspection of the recently \nmigrated account records showed errors in approximately \n50,000 accounts.\nIt took almost six weeks to adjust the incorrect ac-\ncounts and update functions to handle all transaction types \ncorrectly. On June 20, the company attempted to print \nbilling statements for the 50,000 corrected customer ac-\ncounts. The system refused to print any information for \ntransactions more than 30 days old. A panicked consulta-\ntion with the vendor concluded that fixing the 30-day re-\nstriction would require more than a month of work and \ntesting. It was also concluded that manual entry of account \nadjustments followed by billing within 30 days was the fast-\nest and least risky way to solve the immediate problem.\nClearing the backlog took two months. During that \ntime, many incorrect bills were mailed. Customer support \ntelephone lines were continually overloaded. Twenty-five \npeople were reassigned from other operational areas, and \nadditional phone lines were added to provide sufficient cus-\ntomer support capacity. System development personnel \nwere reassigned to IS operations for up to three months \nto assist in clearing the billing backlog. Federal and state \nregulatory authorities stepped in to investigate the prob-\nlems. HudsonBanc agreed to allow customers to spread \npayments for late bills over three months without interest \ncharges. Setting up the payment arrangements further \n\u00ad\naggravated the backlog and staffing problems.\n1.\t\nWhat type of installation did HudsonBanc use for its \nnew system? Was it an appropriate choice?\n2.\t\nHow could the operational problems have been avoided?\nCommunity Board of Realtors\u00ae\nAssume that the Multiple Listing Service that is under \ndevelopment will replace an existing system devel-\noped many years ago. The database requirements and \ndesign for the old and new systems are very similar. \nUnfortunately, the existing system stores its data in a \nMicrosoft Access database, which provides little sup-\nport for simultaneous access and updates by multiple \nusers. An important reason for replacing the current \nsystem is to upgrade to a DBMS that can easily sup-\nport many simultaneous accesses.\nThe current plan is to use Microsoft SQL Server \nas the new DBMS and to migrate all data from the \nexisting Microsoft Access database immediately prior \nto full deployment. Perform these tasks to prepare for \nthis migration:\n\t\n1.\tInvestigate data migration from Microsoft Access \nto SQL Server. What tools are available to assist \nin or perform the migration?
