{"text": "Foreword\nWhen I picked up the final draft of this book, at first I was surprised to see\nthat it was missing any mention of Agile software development. Michael and\nI have been chatting about this book for years now, and I thought I knew\nwhat the book was about and why it must be written: software architecture\nideas, as traditionally described, have been hard to use in Agile processes,\nbut Michael has figured out how to do just that. So how could \u201cAgile\u201d not be\non every page of the book?\nMichael is a modern Prometheus, fascinated by technology and determined\nto tame it for all of humanity. He is a true believer in the benefits of Agile and\nan expert in software architecture. I know of no one else who was walking\nthe walk as an Agile team leader during the day while mentoring Carnegie\nMellon software architecture students at night. I know him best through our\ninvolvement in the SATURN software architecture conference, where he has\nbrought ideas and thought leaders from the Agile community to rub elbows\nwith the architecture community. He has been looking for the best of both\nworlds, a mixture of Agile and architecture that is not oil and water.\nThere have been other attempts to reconcile the differences, but they have\nall been limited. Early attempts tried to shoehorn Agile into the implementation\nphase of a waterfall process. Others implicitly assumed there was still a\n\u201ccorner office architect\u201d making the important decisions. Almost all of them\nwere based in theory rather than reporting on what they had successfully\napplied and were written by an author in one camp trying to pull in ideas\nfrom the other.\nThis book is a different, better synthesis of Agile and architecture, which is\nwhy the word \u201cAgile\u201d is not on every page. It starts with a deep understanding\nand appreciation for Agile values and describes design techniques that are\ncompatible. Michael has invented or adapted many of the techniques himself,\nbut it thrills me to see that he\u2019s also plucked the best ideas from conferences\nover the past few years, techniques that are not yet in any other book.

It also has pictures of teams\nactually applying these techniques.\nThe same thought leaders who overthrew bureaucratic software processes\nalso cautioned us that Agile was not a disguise for undisciplined cowboy\ncoding. Those bureaucratic pre-Agile processes were, for the most part, disci-\nplined, and you knew which design activities you should do and when. Despite\nteams self-reporting that they are following Agile processes, my experience is\nthat there is a lot of undisciplined cowboy coding happening today.\nNow that this book exists, the question is: what happens next? It is hard to\nmake predictions, especially about the future, but here is what I foresee. We\nare on the cusp of a transition to a stable state of software development where\nwe have learned to blend agility and discipline. Our processes will use the\nquick feedback loops popularized by Agile and will guide us to design tech-\nniques that drive quality. Unmistakably, they will be software processes, with\nactivities and techniques uniquely appropriate for software development.\nWe are not there yet, but this book moves us in that direction.

{"text": "Welcome!\nSoftware architecture is the foundation on which awesome software is built.\nA great architecture alone isn\u2019t enough to guarantee your software will be a\nsmashing success, but the wrong architecture almost guarantees failure.\nSoftware architecture is so important that every software developer should\nknow how to design it.\nIn this book, you\u2019ll learn how to design great software architectures. Just to\nbe clear, this isn\u2019t a lesson in Ivory Tower, high-abstraction software design.\nYou also won\u2019t find any magic bean solutions\u2014frameworks and technologies\nthat magically solve any problem. You will learn how to apply essential design\nprinciples and practices, which will make you a stronger programmer, archi-\ntect, and technical leader.\nDesigning great software requires more than mastery of principles and prac-\ntices. How you go about designing a software system is just as important as\nthe final result. In this book, you\u2019ll learn how to use design thinking and\nhuman-centered methods to design software architectures collaboratively\nwith your team. This approach to architecture design helps you forge a\nstronger connection between the design decisions you make and the humans\naffected by those decisions. Putting people first allows you to make better\ndesign decisions and, as a result, better software.\nWho Should Read This Book?\nThis book is for anyone who has ever stood at a whiteboard and sketched\nboxes and lines while trying to answer tough questions.\nIf you\u2019re completely new to software architecture design, then this book is\nthe perfect introduction.

Soon a slight feeling of dread set\nin. I am an architect. Now what do I do? How is being a software architect\ndifferent from being a software engineer?\nSoftware architects have a number of responsibilities in addition to program-\nming. They define the problem from an engineering perspective. They divide\nthe software system into implementable chunks, but also keep an eye on the\nbig picture to ensure the system still works as a consistent whole. Architects\ndecide trade-offs among quality attributes and manage the inevitable growth\nof technical debt. Perhaps above all, architects develop their team\u2019s architec-\nture skills, because they know the best teams are filled with architects.\nIn this chapter, you\u2019ll learn what architects do. You\u2019ll also learn why knowing\nabout software architecture will make you a better programmer and technical\nleader. You\u2019ll also learn how to get started on the path to becoming a software\narchitect in your professional career.\nWhat Software Architects Do\nSoftware architects are in a unique position on the team. They aren\u2019t project\nmanagers, but architects decide when and how software is delivered. They aren\u2019t\nproduct managers, but architects make sure the software meets its business\ngoals.

Growing\nfrom programmer to software architect requires you to accept some new\nresponsibilities.\nDefine the Problem from an Engineering Perspective\nSoftware architecture design is a human-centered design discipline. Everyone\nwith a stake in the software can help you understand what is expected of it.\nSoftware architects work with product managers, project managers, and\nother stakeholders to define business goals and requirements for the software\nto be built.\nOn many teams, product managers define the features. Features are great,\nbut there is another kind of requirement called a quality attribute that archi-\ntects care the most about (see Reason about Quality Attributes (and Other\nSystem Properties), on page 10). In addition to defining quality attributes for\nthe system, architects keep an eye out for design constraints and features\nthat might force the architecture down a specific path.\nDefining the problem with the architecture in mind ensures you can build a\nsystem everyone wants.

Software development, similar\nto soccer games, goes smoother when the software is divided into pieces and\neach piece is assigned a responsibility, a position to play.\nArchitects partition (a fancy word for divide into pieces) the software system\nso they can develop a strategy for achieving quality attributes and other system\nrequirements. For example, you might assign functional responsibilities by\ndesigning one component to register users and another to identify pictures\nof cats. Or you could assign different teams to develop different modules.

Of course, since you broke the system into pieces,\nyou\u2019ll also have to make sure everything can come back together again.\nKeep an Eye on the Bigger Picture\nEvery software system lives in the context of a bigger world.

People, processes, business needs, and many other technical\nand nontechnical factors play a part in the final software system. Even simple\ndesign decisions can have far-reaching consequences. Architects must look\nbeyond a small neighborhood of design decisions and think about the system\nas a whole.\nSoftware design is a constant struggle to find the right balance between the\nthings you want and the reality you must accept. This means you must think\nabout and make trade-offs.\nDecide Trade-offs among Quality Attributes\nSay high availability is an important quality attribute for your stakeholders and\nyou need your software to respond to 99.9 percent of requests. One way to\npromote availability is to introduce redundant elements. Designing for this is\nsimple, but there\u2019s a catch. You now must purchase twice the hardware, which\ndoubles your costs. In this case, you traded costs to get higher availability.\nIt is common in software development to give up something you want to get\nsomething you need. Architects identify the trade-offs and work with stake-\nholders to decide which compromises make the most sense.\nSoftware systems are never partitioned perfectly. You\u2019ll make compromises.\nYou\u2019ll make mistakes. As you build the system, you\u2019ll introduce technical\ndebt into the architecture.\nManage Technical Debt\nSoftware architects know the details about how the system is partitioned.\nThey keep an eye on the big picture and guide how everything comes together.\nThey also connect technology decisions with business needs. Knowing all this\nputs architects in the perfect position to manage technical debt.\nTechnical debt is the gap between your software system\u2019s current design and\nthe design you need it to have so you can continue to deliver value. You can\nmeasure the amount of technical debt by estimating the effort required to\nclose that gap. All software has technical debt. Technical debt is an inevitable\nbyproduct of success. The best software development teams use technical\ndebt strategically to ship faster and regularly pay debt down so they can\ncontinue shipping value over time.\nArchitects make technical debt visible and help stakeholders decide which\nactions to take to manage it.\nChapter 1.

As the\narchitecture expert on your team, it is your responsibility to share your\nknowledge with your team so they can successfully develop an amazing soft-\nware system.\nArchitects teach design skills and architecture concepts just-in-time. To pass\non your knowledge, you\u2019ll pair design with teammates, create documents that\neducate and inform, and share constructive criticism. Perhaps the most\nimportant thing you can do to grow the team\u2019s architecture skills is to include\nthem in the design process. Architecture design is a social activity. Skills\ndevelopment is crucial to your team\u2019s success.\nNow you know what architects do, but we haven\u2019t defined what we mean by\nsoftware architecture yet. Let\u2019s do something about that now.\nWhat Is Software Architecture?\nA system\u2019s software architecture is the set of significant design decisions about\nhow the software is organized to promote desired quality attributes and other\nproperties.\nA design decision might be significant for any number of reasons. It might\nrepresent a point of no return or influence quality attributes, schedule, or\ncosts. A significant decision might be one that affects many people or forces\nother software systems to change. In any case, significant design decisions\nare costly to change later if you get them wrong.\nTo promote a quality attribute means to encourage it to appear in the software\nsystem. When the architecture is well organized, it will boost the quality\nattributes stakeholders want and downplay or eliminate the quality attributes\nstakeholders don\u2019t want. Architecture can promote other properties too. For\nexample, the right architecture for the job will let you ship on time, on budget,\nand without requiring too much overtime.\nDefine the Essential Structures\nA skyscraper has a foundation and frames.

Relations\ndescribe how elements work together to accomplish some task.\nIt\u2019s easy to design an architecture on paper with no bearing on reality. To\navoid this trap, you\u2019ll build architectures using three types of elements and\nrelations. Software Architecture in Practice [BCK12] defines these three types\nas module, component and connector (C&C for short), and allocation. To create\na structure, combine elements and relations of the same type.\nHere are some example elements and relations of each type.\nExample Relations\nExample Elements\nuses, allowed to use,\ndepends on\nclass, package, layer, stored\nprocedure, module, configura-\ntion file, database table\nModule\ncall, subscribe, pipe,\npublish, return\nobject, connection, thread,\nprocess, tier, filter\nComponent and\nConnector\nruns in or on, responsi-\nble for, develops, stores,\npays for\nserver, sensor, laptop, load\nbalancer, team, Owen (a per-\nson), Docker container\nAllocation\nModule structures exist at design time.

Module structures live on the file system and stick\naround even when the software is not running.\nComponent and connector structures come into existence at runtime. At run-\ntime, components can create connections to other components, spawn new\nprocesses, and instantiate new objects. Unlike module structures, C&C\nstructures cease to exist when the system is not running. You might only\nknow a C&C structure existed from the artifacts it left behind, such as a log\nfile or database entry.\nAllocation structures are created by showing how module and C&C elements\ncorrespond with each other and the physical elements that exist in real\nlife. Allocation structures are sometimes called mapping structures since\nthey show how different elements map to one another. Does an element\nrun on the client machine or the server? Which teams are building which\nparts of the system? Allocation structures help us answer questions like\nthese.\nChapter 1.

Technically a component\nis a different concept from a module. A module refers to a design time element\nwhereas a component is a runtime idea.\nSometimes this precision in language is important. Using a term with specific\nmeaning to describe something general can create confusion. Anytime you want to\ndescribe a generic building block of an architecture instead of using component or\nmodule, use the word element.\nAll that said, arguing about semantics is not the best way to get your ideas across.\nWhile I encourage you to use proper and precise terminology, your ideas will sometimes\nget better mileage by adapting your language so others understand you.\nDifferent kinds of structures are useful for thinking about different properties\nyou want in your system. For example, you can think about testability and\nmaintainability using a module structure. A C&C structure helps us think\nabout runtime concerns such as availability or performance.

On other teams, there is no\nexplicit role and teammates share the architect\u2019s responsibilities. Some teams\nsay they don\u2019t have an architect, but if you look closely, someone is fulfilling\nthe architect\u2019s duties without realizing it.\nArchitects are leaders, but being a software architect also implies a person\nwho thinks about software design in a certain way. No matter what the title\non your business card reads (mine still reads software engineer, my choice),\nyou can be a software architect. Every team has at least one architect. The\nbest teams have several.\nIf your team doesn\u2019t have an architect, congratulations, you\u2019ve got the job!\nYou don\u2019t need permission to inject architectural thinking into your team\u2019s\ndesign discussions. Start asking questions about quality attributes. Point out\nwhen the team makes trade-offs. Volunteer to write up design decisions and\nbegin accepting more architecture design responsibilities.\nIf your team already has an architect, then ask that person how you can help.\nWhen possible, work closely with your architect and take advantage of every\nlearning opportunity you can. Developing a software system is a big job. The\nmore people who pay attention to the details, the greater your chance of\nsuccess. Every team should be so lucky as to have many knowledgeable\nsoftware architects!\nMake the Move from Programmer to Software Architect\nAn average software architect has developed three to five software systems\nwith increased technical responsibility on each software system. Depending\non the software you build, as your architecture responsibilities grow you may\nfind you have less time for programming. This is normal, though software\narchitects should never stop programming altogether.\nTo measure your growth from programmer to software architect, create a\nproject portfolio. For every software system you build, no matter your role,\nbriefly describe the software system and what you learned during your time\ndeveloping it.

Software architecture turns a big problem into smaller, more manageable\nproblems.\nModern software systems are large and complex, and they have many\nmoving pieces. The architecture precisely explains how to partition the\nsystem into smaller, bite-sized chunks while also ensuring the system as\na whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\n2. Software architecture shows people how to work together.\nSoftware development is as much about human communication as it is\ntechnology.

Grady Booch echoes Fowler\u2019s sentiment\nby defining architecture as the \u201c\u2026significant design decisions (where\nsignificant is measured by the cost of change).\u201d\n1 Software architects are\nnot omniscient, but designing an architecture will help you discover the\nchallenging (and interesting) parts of the problem that might cause big\ntrouble later.\n6. Software architecture enables agility.\nYour software should respond to change like water, by bending around\nobstacles with ease. If software is like water, able to take any shape, then\nsoftware architecture is the container that holds it. That container can\nbe rigid like a box or flexible like a plastic bag. It can be thick and heavy\nor lightweight. Without an architecture, software, like water, follows the\npath of least resistance and sprawls uncontrollably. A software system\u2019s\narchitecture provides the structure within which change is possible.\nWe\u2019ll expand on these ideas throughout the remainder of the book.\n1.\nGrady Booch.

While\ndesign thinking is not a process, there are still rules to guide our design\nactivities. In Design Thinking: Understand - Improve - Apply (Understanding\nInnovation) [PML10] Christoph Meinel and Larry Leifer propose four universal\nprinciples of design. These principles apply to software architecture as well\nas to detailed program design, user interaction design, or any other design-\nfocused discipline.\nreport erratum  \u2022  discuss\n", "page": 31, "type": "text", "section": "Page 31"}
{"text": "Here are the four principles of design:\n1. Human rule. All design is social in nature.\n2. Ambiguity rule. Preserve ambiguity.\n3. Redesign rule. All design is redesign.\n4. Tangibility rule. Make ideas tangible to facilitate communication.\nWe\u2019ll use the acronym HART to help remember these principles. Let\u2019s examine\nthe HART principles as they relate to software architecture design so we can\nsee how to apply design thinking in the context of software architecture.\nDesign for Humans\nDesign is an inherently human-focused endeavor. We design software for\npeople. We design software with people. Every design decision in the architec-\nture helps individuals in some way. Every design decision must be understood\nby and shared with other humans.\nArchitects must empathize with all stakeholders. We care about end users\nas much as the people the end users help, the programmers who write the\ncode, the testers who verify it, and even the managers who keep tabs on the\ndevelopment schedule. As we design a software system, we\u2019ll collaborate with\nthe other humans on our team and show them respect by listening, assuming\npositive intent, and using human-centered design methods.\nThe Human rule also reminds us that architects are not separated from our\nteams. We work directly with them to design the architecture together.\nBuilding software is an intensely social activity. The idea of an ivory tower\narchitect who designs the architecture isolated from the team is a myth.\nSoftware architects are an integral part of every team. Separating the architect\nfrom the team severs the human connection the architect shares with everyone\ntouched by the architecture.\nEmpathizing with the humans who directly and indirectly interact with the\narchitecture makes us a better designer, communicator, and leader.\nPreserve Ambiguity\nAmbiguity in engineering is dangerous. Once we\u2019ve made a design decision,\nwe must share it with precision and clarity. Allowing requirements, design\ndecisions, and commitments to remain ambiguous is the best way to destroy\na project. Before we solidify a design decision, we can use ambiguity to keep\noptions open.\nChapter 2.

In Less is more with\nminimalist architecture [MB02], Ruth Malan and Dana Bredemeyer suggest\narchitects design a minimalist architecture. A minimalist architecture only\nshows how high-priority quality attributes are achieved and reduces risks for\npromoting those quality attributes. All other design decisions are left open\nfor downstream designers to determine.\nArchitecture minimalism implies that we want to defer binding design decisions\nfor as long as responsible. Design decisions that do not directly influence a\nquality attribute or reduce risks threatening our ability to deliver software\nare more about detailed design than architecture. Such decisions can safely\nbe left open for downstream designers to settle outside the architecture. You\u2019ll\nlearn more about preserving ambiguity in Design for Change, on page 75.\nPreserving ambiguity allows us to deliver software even as the world around\nus changes.\nDesign Is Redesign\nIn A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction [AISJ77], Christopher\nAlexander and others cataloged over 253 civil engineering problems with\nknown good solutions.

As time goes on and as we build more\nsoftware, our institutional knowledge about how to design great software\nimproves. Other teams have probably seen a problem similar to the one you\nface currently. Hopefully, someone documented a pattern you can use as a\nstarting point for your architecture. Maybe someone built a framework\ndesigned to solve your exact problem?\nWhen designing software architectures, we\u2019ll spend more time refining existing\ndesigns than we\u2019ll be creating new ones.

The understand mindset is as much about\nrequirements as it is empathy. To understand the problem, we must learn\nabout the people who will be touched by our system and what they need.\nChapter 2.

We\u2019ll also have to\nlearn how our team operates and get a deeper sense of the priorities and\ntrade-offs among design decisions.\nExplore Ideas\nIn the popular ethos, design thinking is all about brainstorming and sticky\nnotes. Brainstorming is powerful, but it is only one practice in the explore\nmindset. When we explore, we create multiple design concepts and identify\nengineering approaches for solving some aspect of a problem.\nExploring software architecture means we try combinations of structures\nuntil we find a combination that best promotes desired quality attributes. To\nfind the best mix of structures, we\u2019ll need to survey a broad range of patterns,\ntechnologies, and development practices. When we\u2019re planning the architec-\nture, we\u2019ll spend a lot of time in the exploration mindset, but this mindset is\nalso useful when working with stakeholders.\nMake It Real\nAs you learned in Make the Architecture Tangible, on page 17, ideas are great\nbut if you can\u2019t transfer them from your brain into someone else\u2019s brain, then\nyour ideas are useless. Making ideas real gives us a way to share them but\nalso provides an opportunity for testing an idea. In the make mindset we turn\nour design concepts into real-world artifacts.\nThe most common ways we make architecture real is by creating models.\nMaking goes way beyond box and line diagrams. You can make the architec-\nture real by building prototypes, writing documents, crunching numbers, and\na variety of other approaches.\nThe make mindset is useful for communicating our plans.

Making\nis also an excellent way to push your team out of analysis paralysis.\nEvaluate Fit\nHow do you know if a design decision will solve the problem? When we\nembrace the evaluate mindset, we determine the fitness of our design decisions\nrelative to our current understanding.\nEvaluation is not an all or none proposition. We can evaluate all or part of\nthe architecture, even only a single model, concept, or idea. The most common\napproach is to walk through a piece of the architecture with different scenarios,\nbut we can also test design decisions directly by running experiments or\nexamining the risks surrounding a decision.\nThe evaluate mindset comes in handy when we want to verify the planned or\nbuilt architecture, but this is only the beginning. This mindset will help us\ninspect anything we make and decide whether that artifact is serving our need.\nUsing design mindsets requires a process with a tight feedback loop so we\ncan quickly move from one mindset to the next. In the next section, we\u2019ll learn\nhow to use a simple, iterative approach to help us choose and use design\nmindsets.\n Get Your Hands Dirty: Understand, Explore, Make, Evaluate\nThe four design thinking mindsets reflect how people solve problems. Even\nwithout training in design thinking, you have probably used these mindsets\nbefore. What are some examples of how you embraced each of these mindsets\nso far in your software development career? Try to name at least two examples\nof how you worked in each design mindset.\nHere are some things to think about:\n\u2022 When have you worked with people to understand a problem? Did you\nfollow a particular method?\n\u2022 How have you collaborated with others to explore ideas and generated\nalternatives?\n\u2022 Looking beyond code, how do the things you make change how you\ninteract with stakeholders and teammates?\n\u2022 How do you evaluate your designs?

Despite the swirl\nof uncertainty surrounding every software system, it\u2019s important to have a\nplan. With a solid design strategy, we can feel our way through the mists of\nuncertainty.\nDesign thinking is perfect for finding solutions to complex problems. Instead\nof trying to solve the problem perfectly on the first try, design thinking\nemphasizes learning and experimentation. Testing an architecture might be\nimpossible without implementing it, but it may be possible to verify pieces of\nthe architecture incrementally as we design them. We can use design mindsets\nand the think-do-check cycle to decide where to focus our attention next.\nIn Chapter 2, Design Thinking Fundamentals, on page 15 you learned the\nbasic rules of design thinking and how to use design mindsets. In this chapter,\nyou\u2019ll learn how to choose design mindsets as part of a broader design strat-\negy by thinking about the risks in the software system.\nFind a Design That Satisfices\nIn a rational world, we\u2019d fully define the problem before designing a perfect\narchitecture to solve it. Too bad we don\u2019t live in a perfect, rational world. In\nThe Sciences of the Artificial [Sim96], Herbert Simon coined the term bounded\nrationality to describe the theoretical barrier created by limits in time, money,\nskills, and knowledge that make rational design challenging for complex\nproblems such as software architecture.\nInstead of rationally seeking an optimal design, our goal is to find an archi-\ntecture that satisfices.

{"text": "Instead of thinking of software architecture as a design optimization problem,\nwe\u2019ll look for a satisficing design by emphasizing the following activities.\nTreat solutions as experiments. Architects are not omniscient sages of\ntechnology who know all things. Think of every potential solution as an\nexperiment to be validated. The sooner, faster, and cheaper we can validate\n(or invalidate) our hypotheses, the sooner we\u2019ll find the right combination\nof structures that will help our stakeholders and the sooner our stakehold-\ners will gain value from our designs.\nFocus on reducing risks. Value is only one variable that must be considered.\nArchitecture is the foundation of the software system. If it fails, then\neverything fails. Architects must constantly worry about what could go\nwrong and design for these scenarios. We can use risk to help us decide\nwhat to design next.\nWork to simplify problems. Simple problems often have simple solutions.\nThere are many ways to simplify the problem. Reducing the number of\nstakeholders will decrease the variety of competing perspectives influencing\nthe system. Adding or removing constraints, or focusing on a subset of\nthe problem can reduce complexity. Identifying the routine problems makes\nit easier to focus on redesign. Routine problems have a known solution\nso we can start with pattern catalogs and apply our collective experience\nwhen exploring solutions.\nIterate quickly to learn quickly. The faster we learn, the more we can explore,\nand the greater confidence we\u2019ll have in our solutions. If we\u2019re wrong, let\u2019s\nfind out as quickly as possible. Failing fast means learning fast.

The boundary around a\nproblem is created by the solutions that could potentially solve it. To\nunderstand the problem, we must explore solutions. To do a better job\nof exploring solutions, we must improve our understanding of the problem.\nDesigning software architecture requires us to think about problems and\nsolutions simultaneously.

Selecting a design strategy early in a software system\u2019s life tells our\nteam how we want to grow the architecture and instills confidence in our\nstakeholders.\nDecide How Much to Design Up Front\nArchitecture is a necessary investment. Every software system has an archi-\ntecture. One way or another, you will spend time designing it. If we spend\ntime designing architecture up front, then we\u2019ll reduce the cost of future\nrework. Of course, time spent planning architecture also delays implementa-\ntion thus potentially delaying value for stakeholders. If we spend no time up\nfront on architecture, then we are more likely to make changes to the archi-\ntecture after developing parts of the software system.\nDepending on the software system\u2019s size and requirements variability, every\nsoftware systems has a design sweet spot, an optimal amount of time to spend\ndesigning architecture before diving into implementation.\nFind the Design Sweet Spot\nIn Architecting: How Much and When? [BWO10], Barry Boehm shows us that\nthe combination of development time, architecture planning, and rework are\nmajor contributing factors to the overall project schedule. Rework includes\nactivities such as fixing design defects, rewriting code, and undoing mistakes.\nTo find the sweet spot, we must account for both design costs and the\ninevitable rework required to complete the software system.\nDevelopment Time\nArchitecture and Risk Reduction Time\nRework Time (fixing defects, rewrites, mistakes)\nTotal Project Time\n+\nNote: Time spent on architecture can\nspeed up development and reduce rework!\nThe architecture sweet spot is highly dependent on the size, requirements\nvolatility, and complexity of the software you\u2019re developing.

From Boehm\u2019s research, as little as 5 percent of the total esti-\nmated development schedule might be spent on up-front architecture\ndesign. In some cases, it can be faster to rewrite a small software system\nthan to spend significant time designing architecture up front.\nExpect violent thrashing if you invest little into architecture design.\nAvoiding up-front architecture design in smaller software systems might\nbe more cost effective and result in a shorter overall schedule, but rework\nwill still be necessary.

Every time you\nthink, I\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this, it\u2019s a sign there\u2019s a risk looming nearby.\nIf you can pick a condition and consequence that captures the essence of your\nbad feeling, then we can use that information to guide our design activities.\nHere are some example risks from a past project I worked on and the design\nactivities the team used to reduce the risk:\nThe Model Training service was originally built for a different purpose; might\noverload it with new requests.\nDesign Mindsets: Understand, Evaluate\nWhat we did: Talked to the team who built the Model Training service to\nunderstand scalability, ran experiments to measure throughput.\nData processing is time consuming and resource intensive; might not be\nable to finish processing jobs without failures.\nDesign Mindset: Explore\nWhat we did: Brainstormed approaches for promoting reliability, researched\njob scheduling patterns, and sketched alternative designs that might\nreduce processing time.\nChapter 3.

When I talk to customers, I often hear horror\nstories about how their current systems were developed by someone in an ivory tower\nwho didn\u2019t understand them or their work. How do I make sure I am bringing value\nto customers through my architecture?\nMy answer is to use a customer-centric design process. I start with who the customer\nis and what they want to do. I divide the system into tasks the customer performs.\nFor each task, I find out how they start it and where they run into issues.\nYou might be thinking, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound like architecture\u2014it sounds like user\nexperience!\u201d Yes, it is, but many UX designers don\u2019t understand the technical aspects\nof the system well enough to determine the architecture.

{"text": "Joe asks:\nAre Quality Attributes Non-functional\nRequirements?\nTraditional software engineering textbooks usually discuss two classes of requirements.\nFunctional requirements describe the behavior of the software system. Non-functional\nrequirements describe all system requirements that aren\u2019t functional requirements,\nincluding what we\u2019re calling quality attributes and constraints.\nWhen you are designing a software architecture, it\u2019s useful to distinguish between\nfunctionality, \nconstraints, \nand \nquality \nattributes \nbecause \neach \ntype \nof \nrequirement \nimplies\na different set of forces are influencing the design. For example, constraints are non-\nnegotiable whereas quality attributes can be nuanced and involve significant trade-offs.\nYes, quality attributes are non-functional requirements, but it is strange to use this\nterm to describe them since quality attribute scenarios (sometimes called quality\nrequirements) have a functional piece to them. Quality attributes make sense only\nin the context of system operation. In a quality attribute scenario, an artifact\u2019s\nresponse is the direct result of some function.\nCapture Quality Attributes as Scenarios\nA quality attribute is just a word. Scalability, availability, and performance\nare meaningless by themselves. We need to give these words meaning so we\nunderstand what to design. We use a quality attribute scenario to provide an\nunambiguous description of a quality attribute.\nQuality attribute scenarios describe how the software system is expected to\noperate within a certain environmental context. There is a functional compo-\nnent to each scenario\u2014stimulus and response\u2014just like any feature. Quality\nattributes scenarios differ from functional requirements since they qualify\nthe response using a response measure. It is not enough just to correctly\nrespond. How the system responds is also important. The diagram on page\n53 visually depicts the six parts of a quality attribute scenario.\nStimulus The stimulus is an event that requires the system to respond in\nsome way. The stimulus kicks off the scenario and will vary depending\non the type quality attribute. For example, the stimulus for an availability\nmight be a node becoming unreachable whereas the stimulus for a modi-\nfiability scenario might be a request for a change.\nSource The source is the person or system that initiations the stimulus.\nExamples include users, system components, and external systems.\nChapter 5.

Raw scenarios are simple descriptions that form the basis for more\nprecise quality attribute scenarios. We call them raw because they need further\ncooking to become a good scenario.

What if it\ntook nine months to migrate the system to a new microcontroller platform,\nwould that work? How about six months?

If you can\u2019t write a test using your scenario, then the sce-\nnario does not have a specific, measurable response measure.\nChoose Appropriate Response Measures\nI was once on a team responsible for building a simulation testbed for a military\ncombat system. The purpose of the testbed was to connect a dozen military bases\nacross the world so we could play simulated war games. To run a test, we would play\na scenario that generated fake aircraft. The hardware and software at each site would\ndetect the simulated aircraft, and the combat systems would process the sensor data\nas if it were from the real world.\nThe simulation testbed had extremely aggressive latency requirements. If all sites did\nnot receive the same simulation data within a narrow window of time, it would seem\nas if aircraft were appearing and disappearing from the sky. Even worse, aircraft\nmight be visible only to some sites in the network. Too much latency would invalidate\nthe system tests.\nAfter crunching some numbers, we determined our testbed would need to transfer\ndata faster than the speed of light for everything to work. The performance and\navailability response measures were nowhere near reality. Once quantum entangled\nnetworks become viable, it will be interesting to revisit this problem.\n Get Your Hands Dirty: Refine These Notes into Quality\nAttribute Scenarios\nDuring a meeting, Project Lionheart stakeholders shared the following state-\nments.

All functional requirements are essential to the\nsuccess of the software system, but not all system features have architectural\nsignificance. When a functional requirement drives architectural decision\nmaking, we call it an influential functional requirement.\nInfluential functional requirements can be referred to as architecture killers.

Taking someone else\u2019s perspective and showing\nempathy will help you understand their expectations of your software. Technical\ntraining and experience then turn requirements into implementable ideas. However,\nyou will need excellent communication skills to get developers and management to\nshare your vision and turn ideas into code.\nOne of the most useful communication skills I had to learn is active listening. Hearing\nwhat someone says is only the first step. You also have to understand it. Here is a\nsurprisingly challenging exercise that I learned during a course on communication.\nYou can try this exercise with a partner.\nPerson A tells a story to person B, for example about an achievement or describing\na problem they solved. The trick is that person B is not allowed to say a word until\nperson A indicates they are finished. Only then is person B allowed to ask questions\nto increase understanding of what person A said. The questions cannot be covert\nfeedback or critique. Person B\u2019s goal is to reach an understanding. Now reverse roles\nto experience the other side of the relationship.\nImagine how hard this exercise can be! You probably know a colleague who talks a\nlittle bit too much or a shy and quiet intern. How would you ensure that you under-\nstand their requirements?\nWriting down directly what a stakeholder tells you probably won\u2019t lead to an imple-\nmentable requirement. Human language is messy, complicated, and full of culturally\nloaded messages\u2014nothing like COBOL, Java, PHP, or Python. Culture does not only\ndiffer between countries or religions. Cities, companies, schools, and sports clubs\nhave cultures, which influence how people communicate.\nAs an active listener, you need empathy to put words into their cultural context and\nunderstand them. Remain quiet, don\u2019t judge, and ask questions to help you understand.\nCommunication skills are hard to learn from books, yet I recommend two to assist\nyou on your way to becoming an amazing software architect.

There are two basic methods for deploying a\nnew version of a service with multiple instances: red/black or rolling upgrade.\nA red/black deployment (some names use different colors like blue/green) allocates\nsufficient virtual machines for all instances of the new version, deploys the new version\ninto those instances, and then switches to use the new instances. A rolling upgrade\nwill upgrade one instance at a time.\nIn either case, there are possibilities of inconsistencies. For example, suppose you\nhave a chain of services\u2014Service A depends on Service B, which in turn depends on\nService C. Now one of your developers deploys a new version of Service B. This new\nversion may change the syntax or semantics of the interface. What happens when\nService A invokes Service B and gets an incorrect error because the semantics of an\ninterface has changed? What happens when the new version of Service B assumes a\nnew version of Service C, and the new version of Service C has yet to be deployed?\nIf you are deploying new versions using a rolling upgrade strategy, then it is possible\nthat two different versions of Service B with different interfaces will simultaneously\nbe executing.\nThere are a collection of techniques used to overcome these inconsistencies\u2014enforcing\nbackward compatibility, using feature toggles, gracefully handling unknown responses\nfrom a dependent service\u2014but the first step is recognizing that deployment and\ndeployment strategies can cause inconsistencies when multiple instances of a service\nare being run.\nAccept Constraints\nIn Limit Design Options with Constraints, on page 49 you learned that con-\nstraints are predetermined design decisions that cannot be changed. Recall\nthere are two types of constraints: technical and business. Technical con-\nstraints limit your technical options whereas business constraints focus on\npeople, process, cost, and schedule.\nWe have no choice but to embrace technical constraints and incorporate them\ninto the architecture. If we agree that the system must be written in .NET,\nthen there is no point lamenting over the loss of your favorite Java framework.\nChapter 6.

You might consider several architectural\ndecisions to satisfy this constraint:\n\u2022 Choose a pattern that promotes concurrent development effort.\n\u2022 Choose a pattern that promotes incremental delivery.\n\u2022 Choose technologies the team is familiar with to reduce risks.\n\u2022 Choose technologies that support automation and development speed.\n\u2022 Choose to skip planning, accept technical debt, and build a ball of mud.\n\u2022 Choose combinations of all these ideas.\nBusiness constraints can also be satisfied outside the architecture\u2014for\nexample, by emphasizing craftsmanship and early testing, or by using a\nsubcontractor with lower hourly rates.\nRemember that early design decisions can become constraining, but they are\nnot constraints. Like the load-bearing walls of a house, these early design\ndecisions hold everything else in place. Moving a load-bearing wall in a house\nmight be costly and challenging, but it is technically possible.

Shortly after the acquisition, our new corporate legal team informed us\nabout some new policies. One of the big policy changes required that we no longer\nuse open source software released under certain licenses.\nThis new constraint, handed down by the legal team, created nearly a year of new\ndevelopment work. The lesson: Stakeholders don\u2019t always understand how a constraint\nmight impact the architecture.

For now, let\u2019s see a simple example of\nhow we can use quality attributes to choose an appropriate pattern.\nSay we want to build a web-based, data-driven application. What patterns\nwould you choose for this application? There are three decent options: 3-tier,\npublish-subscribe, and service-oriented as shown in the figure on page 70.\nOption A: 3-Tier Pattern. Introduced on page 92, each tier is responsible for\ndifferent application concerns. For a web application, the display tier\nrenders the UI, the business tier operates server side to verify business\nrules, and the database stores data.\nOption B: Publish-Subscribe Pattern.

It\u2019s easy to test, easy to deploy,\nand easy to describe. This simplicity comes at a cost. The multi-tier pattern\ndoes not promote quality attributes such as scalability and availability.\nDepending on other quality attribute scenarios, this pattern may not address\nall our needs without augmenting the architecture with other patterns.\nThe publish-subscribe pattern is highly modifiable and extremely flexible.\nThis flexibility makes it easy to build loosely coupled systems. While this\nflexibility and modifiability are attractive, there is a downside. Message order\nmatters to the events in our data-driven application, but the publish-subscribe\npattern alone can\u2019t guarantee message order. With the right message bus\ntechnology, we might make this pattern work, but it feels awkward.\nLike the other patterns, service-oriented architecture is modifiable, flexible, and\ntestable. Service-oriented systems are also scalable and promote availability\neasier than our other options. It\u2019s also the most complex of the three patterns\nunder discussion and has the steepest infrastructure curve.

As software\ngrows, the sheer size of the system can overwhelm the teams who develop it.\nWithout constant vigilance, software systems eventually become victims of\ntheir own success.\nAll hope is not lost. When complexity rears its ugly head, we have options for\nkeeping it in check. We can make the software smaller again by altering the\nrequirements and snipping out code. We can divide big, complex things into\nsmaller things that are easier to reason about and manage. We can also hide\ndetails and think about the software from the perspective of coarser-grained\nabstractions.\nIn Define the Essential Structures, on page 7 you learned that architecture\nis made up of structures, which in turn are composed of elements and rela-\ntions. In this chapter you\u2019ll learn how to use these basic building blocks to\ncreate meaningful models that help us reason about our designs.\nReason About the Architecture\nThere is a finite amount of information we can keep in our heads at any given\ntime. Over the years, software developers have created cheats to work around\nthe limitations in our brains. One cheat is to turn problem solving into a\nmassively parallel operation by collaborating with other humans. Another\ninvolves creating new, abstract concepts to represent chunks of knowledge.\nreport erratum  \u2022  discuss\n", "page": 112, "type": "text", "section": "Page 112"}

For\nexample, an interface of a class in object-oriented programming describes\nthe public methods but says nothing about how we should implement those\nmethods. The concrete implementation of the interface provides those details.\nRemoving these distracting details tightens focus on what you want to think\nabout: the interface.\nOf course, the perfect abstraction is not useful if we can\u2019t share it. Anyone\ncan draw boxes and lines. Creating a genuinely useful model of the architec-\nture takes serious thought. A model, unlike any old sketch, is a precise and\naccurate description of some piece of the architecture that enhances commu-\nnication and can be used to reason about the system.\nGood architecture models have many benefits:\nModels establish the vocabulary of design. Words matter. A good element\nname will convey meaning and intent. Each model we create extends the\nsoftware system\u2019s vocabulary. We use this vocabulary in our day-to-day\ndiscussions, but it also permeates the code we write and shapes the way\nwe see the world.\nModels direct our attention to interesting details. In software development,\ndetails are everything. Just because all details are important it does not\nmean we want to (or have the cognitive capacity to) think about all the\ndetails at the same time. Models let us hide some details so we can focus\nonly on what is needed at this moment to answer a specific question.\nModels allow us to reason about quality attributes and other system prop-\nerties. Models make it easier to think about and describe how the system\nwould behave. If we build the right models of our architecture, we can\nuse them to test our designs before implementing the system too. We\u2019ll\nstill need to run experiments and build prototypes so that we can learn\nhow to create accurate models. Even then, running an experiment is sig-\nnificantly cheaper and faster than learning that the design stinks after\nwe built the whole system!\nModels capture the architect\u2019s intent. All developers should understand why\nwe designed the system the way we did. Great models express the intent\nbehind the structures. The more people who understand this intent, the\ngreater the chance we\u2019ll have of maintaining the system\u2019s conceptual\ndesign integrity as we evolve the system over time.\nChapter 8.

Every model has concepts\nand rules, which describe how to use those concepts. Correctly applying the\nrules keeps the model consistent with our perception of the world.\nJoe asks:\nWhat if I Want to Skip All This Modeling Stuff\nand Start Writing Code Now?\nGregor Hohpe, author of Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing and Deploying\nMessaging Solutions [HW04] and 37 Things and Architect Knows: A Chief Architect\u2019s\nJourney [Hoh16], has a saying: A month of coding can save an hour of architecting. We\nknow that architecture flaws are cheaper and faster to fix while we\u2019re still designing\narchitecture than when we\u2019re writing code, running acceptance tests, or (gasp!) reviewing\ncustomer complaints after release. Gregor knows that an architecture problem is much\nfaster to fix while it\u2019s on a whiteboard than captured in thousands of lines of code.\nWriting code is a fantastic way to learn about the system and how to design it. We\nshould write code early. We should run experiments and build prototypes while we\u2019re\ndiscovering the architecture. Thinking about models is not a substitute for firsthand\nexperience. It is impossible to predict everything about a software system only with\ndiagrams.\nAs you learned in Decide How Much to Design Up Front, on page 29, we\u2019ll end up with\nan architecture whether we design it up front, let it emerge as we write code, or do a\nlittle of both.

A month of coding can save an hour of architecting.\nDesign the Meta-Model\nA software system\u2019s architectural meta-model defines the concepts used in a\nmodel and the rules for how those concepts are applied. The meta-model is\nlike a cognitive grammar for design. It constrains our thinking and creates\nthe vocabulary we use to talk about the architecture.\n1 The diagram on page\n102 summarizes these ideas.\nDefining a meta-model makes it easier to describe the architecture, set expecta-\ntions for our audience, and reason about the models we create.

As we individuate new ideas in the architecture,\nwe update our understanding of the world and the models that represent it.\nYou have individuated concepts naturally since birth. Imagine the first time\nyou encountered a door as a toddler. By watching adults use doors, you\nsurmised that you could open doors by turning knobs. You individuated the\nconcept of a door as distinct from a wall because you figured out that doors\nhave knobs. One day you turned a knob to open a door, and it didn\u2019t budge.\nThrough this discovery, you individuated the concept of a locked door as\ndistinct from an unlocked door and updated your internal mental model of\nthe world.\nTo individuate concepts, we follow a simple process called the curiosity cycle\n[Mug14].

{"text": "Pick a Pattern to Seed the Architecture\nAs discussed in The Four Principles of Design Thinking, on page 15, all design\nis redesign. Patterns are the ultimate example of the redesign rule in action.\nArchitecture patterns describe a prepackaged meta-model relevant to a spe-\ncific problem. Pick an appropriate pattern, and the meta-model is free.\nWe explore several popular patterns in Chapter 7, Create a Foundation with\nPatterns, on page 79. Notice how each pattern describes the elements, rela-\ntions, and rules. Each pattern\u2019s meta-model is complete, consistent, but also\nflexible so that designers may use the pattern under varying circumstances.\nMost architectures include one or two thematic patterns to seed the system\u2019s\ndesign. Even with these thematic patterns, there are still many details to sort\nout. As we add new concepts to the meta-model, it is possible that could\nundermine the patterns in our architecture\u2019s foundation.\nReconcile Inconsistencies\nCombining meta-models\u2014for example, by merging patterns\u2014may introduce\ninconsistencies in the combined meta-model. For example, two meta-models\nmight define a worker element, but the responsibilities for the worker and\nrules for its use are radically different. Reconciling inconsistencies involves\nmerging similar concepts and renaming different concepts with the same\nname so that they remain distinct. Rules may also need to be adjusted. Failure\nto resolve these inconsistencies can undermine our design efforts.\nAs we add new concepts to the meta-model, the rules for using those concepts\nshould also be updated. Rules describe how elements and relations interact in\nthe \nsystem. \nThey \nmust \nreflect \nreality. \nFor \nexample, \nmany \nprogramming \nlanguages\nhave strict type systems. If we implemented a pipe-and-filter system (introduced\non page 84) using a language with strong types, then the meta-model should\ninclude rules about types. If the language we choose doesn\u2019t enforce types, then\nwe\u2019ll need to define message descriptions or protocol headers.\nRules also describe conceptual constraints we choose to place on the architec-\nture. Conceptual constraints allow us to promote specific quality attributes.\nFor example, in the layers pattern (introduced on page 80), an element within\na layer is only allowed to use other elements in the same layer or the layer\ndirectly below it. We created this rule to promote maintainability. Violate this\nrule, and we\u2019ll end up with an unmaintainable bowl of spaghetti.\nChapter 8.

Most models are a representation of the architecture, inherently divorced\nfrom the code. Without care, the ideas discussed in our models will never\nmake their way into the code we write. Alas, all our thinking and reasoning\nabout quality attributes is for naught!\nDespair not. With some thought, we can build many of our architecture\nmodels directly into the code. There are many benefits to building architecture\nmodels into the code. When the architecture is self-evident within the code,\nit\u2019s easier to maintain conceptual design integrity and promote desired quality\nattributes. Building models into the code decreases the chances of architec-\ntural drift since models and code move nearly in lock step. We also alleviate\nthe need for some documentation since we\u2019ve embedded design intent into\nthe software system itself.\nUnfortunately, in Just Enough Software Architecture: A Risk-Driven Approach\n[Fai10], George Fairbanks shows us that it is not possible to directly realize\nall design concepts from the architecture\u2019s conceptual meta-model in code.\nIt is possible to shrink this model-code gap, but we can\u2019t close it completely.\nTo shrink the gap between our models and the code, we can use what Fair-\nbanks calls an architecturally evident coding style. With this approach, we\nembed hints about our models, their rules for use, and the rationale behind\nthe design into the code.

{"text": "Apply the Vocabulary of the Architecture\nTerminology mismatch is a common source of confusion when moving from\narchitectural abstractions to code. The architecture talks about layers, services,\nand filters, but the code implements packages, classes, and methods. The sim-\nplest way to embed a model is to use the vocabulary of the architecture.\nIf we\u2019re using layers, then let\u2019s call our code packages layers. If we\u2019ve adopted\na pipe-and-filter pattern, our classes should be named pipes and filters. If we\ntalk about pilots and navigators in our system metaphors, then we should\nuse these words as names for types and instances.\nEmbedding the domain model into the code is another way to shrink the gap\nbetween models and code. Modeling code after domain concepts is a common\npractice in object-oriented programming. Many frameworks, including object-\nrelational mappers and actor-based systems, assume (or at least strongly\nencourage) a domain model as part of the implementation. Modeling the\ndomain in this way is a core tenet of domain-driven design and several other\ndesign methodologies. Similarly, event-based and reactive patterns lean\nheavily on insights derived from event models derived from domain workflows.\nOrganize Code to Make Patterns Obvious\nGood naming is just the beginning. How we organize the code dramatically\naffects architectural structures in code. A compiler will happily build your\nJava application whether every class is in the same file or classes are logically\norganized around thematic packages.

{"text": "There are other ways to organize this code. Instead of using traditional layers,\nwe could have created functionality-oriented modules. With this pattern, all\nclasses required to complete a functional area are contained within a single\npackage. Classes external to the functional package would not be able to\naccess the business logic or data access classes.\nOrganizing code so that it matches the designed module structures should be\na standard best practice. Patterns on a whiteboard don\u2019t promote quality\nattributes. The code does. If you can\u2019t see the pattern in the built system, then\nit doesn\u2019t exist. If the pattern wasn\u2019t implemented, then desired quality attributes\ncan\u2019t be satisfied as designed. Simon Brown has done a lot of work in this area\nand shares several examples in Software Architecture for Developers [Bro16].\nOrganizing code into packages that correspond to architectural elements is\nthe least we can do. Even better is to enforce the relations so that it becomes\nvirtually impossible to violate the architecture.\nEnforce Relations Among Elements\nThe problem with most architectures is that they rely on discipline and vigi-\nlance to maintain conceptual integrity. Instead of relying on discipline alone,\nlook for ways to enforce the architecture in code. It is impossible (or at least\nreally difficult) to disobey design decisions enforced by the code.\nThe degree to which we can enforce the architecture depends on the type of\nstructures we\u2019re dealing with, the programming languages, operating environ-\nment, and the other technical factors.\nModule Structures\nModule structures are the simplest to see in the code but often the most dif-\nficult to enforce. In most modern programming languages, we can enforce an\nallowed to use relation by limiting access to specific modules. If that fails, it\u2019s\nusually possible to distribute modules as a library with decent documentation.\nWhen we can\u2019t enforce relations, we can at least monitor them. Use static\nanalysis tools to identify violations of the uses, allowed to use, or requires\nrelations. In some programming languages, you might use types creatively to\nrender relations among elements visible and easy to monitor.\nComponent and Connector Structures\nOne approach to enforcing component and connector models is to design\nthe system to fail fast when the architecture is violated. Design by contract,\nfirst \ndefined \nin \nObject-Oriented \nSoftware \nConstruction \n[Mey97], \nis \nan \napproach\nwhere pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants are added to the code\nreport erratum  \u2022  discuss\nBuild Models into the Code \u2022 109\n", "page": 122, "type": "text", "section": "Page 122"}

Contracts work at many\ngranularities \nof \nabstraction, \nincluding \nobjects, \nservices, \nand \nprocesses \nacross\nthreads.\nAnother common approach to enforcing C&C models is to prevent connections\nbetween components that should not be connected. One example is to require\nauthentication between components, a common practice when connecting to\na data source from a data access tier.\nThe swift rise in popularity of microservices architecture is in part due to the\nfact that the pattern makes domain models visible and enforceable at runtime.\nEnforcing allowed to use relations within module structures can be challeng-\ning. Turn those modules into components, and we can enforce interaction\nrules at runtime.\nAllocation Structures\nExpressing the intent behind allocation models in the code used to be\nextremely difficult. It is not possible to describe and enforce allocation models\nin the code thanks to the rise of technologies and paradigms such as platform-\nas-a-service, container technologies (for example, Docker), infrastructure as\ncode, and distributed version control systems.\nTreating infrastructure as code creates opportunities for static analysis.\nAutomating build and deployment pipelines to take advantage of cloud-based\nplatforms means we can introduce automated architecture checks into the\ndeployment process. Most platform-as-a-service products can test hardware\nallocation limits. We can also use configuration and automation to enforce\nhardware scaling and platform provisioning.\nContainers are lightweight and disposable compared to physical hardware\nand traditional virtual machines. With containers, it is possible to adopt\nsimple and easy-to-enforce allocation patterns such as installing one process\nper container.\nDistributed version control combined with web-based tools such as GitHub\nmakes it easy to allocate teams to specific architectural components while\nmaintaining an open, social development culture. Workflows such as fork\nand pull or upstream repository limit access without preventing collaboration.\nAdd Hints as Comments\nCode itself can only take our models so far.

Of\ncourse, nobody was ready for the professor to take their project when the cart\ncame around, but that didn\u2019t stop the professor from taking it anyway. As a\nresult, students followed after the cart, feverishly working en charrette, in the\ncart, to finish their bridges and buildings, attaching bits of balsa wood and\ntwists of wire as the professor wheeled the cart off to pick up the next student\u2019s\nproject.\nIn the twenty-first century, charrette is a style of workshop inspired by the\nidea that more time does not necessarily lead to better designs. Architecture\nprofessors in nineteenth-century France knew this, and it\u2019s a great lesson\nstill today. The user experience (UX) community popularized the charrette as\nthe design studio. A design studio encourages group collaboration and has\nstrict time constraints to help the team see a broad range of ideas in a short\ntime frame.\nIn this chapter, you\u2019re going to learn how to plan and facilitate an architecture\ndesign studio.

Fun amplifies engagement, which in turn acts as\na force multiplier for the speed and effectiveness of exploration activities.\nOur job as a design studio host is to plan a workshop that results in a strong\nset of actionable ideas. Three types of ideas come out of a design studio:\nIdeas for things to make. Some ideas will seem promising. The next step for\nthese ideas is to flesh out details by making models or prototypes.\nIdeas that need more research. Some ideas will seem right but consist of\nbroad assumptions or miss important information. Plan to investigate\nthese ideas further by running experiments or performing research.\nDepending on what you learn during the investigation, some ideas might\nbe scratched whereas others become candidates for the architecture.\nIdeas that open new questions. Sometimes you might only end up with new\nquestions about the problem we\u2019re solving. This is a fantastic outcome\nfor a design studio workshop. It\u2019s better to have these questions now than\nwhen we\u2019ve been heads down coding for a few weeks.

Gathering\na group to design architecture is not a good use of anyone\u2019s time until you\nat least partially understand the problem you\u2019ll to explore.\nPreparing for a workshop can take serious time and should not be underesti-\nmated. Talk to stakeholders. Do your research. Work to define the business\ngoals. Refine quality attributes and other architecturally significant require-\nments (ASRs). Before starting the workshop, you should understand enough\nof the problem and context so that you can articulate useful workshop goals.\nDefine one or two workshop goals that clearly describe what the group will\nexplore during the workshop. You don\u2019t want one person designing a database\nwhile someone else is working on deadlock problems. It\u2019s OK if you only par-\ntially understand the problem before starting the workshop. Exploring solu-\ntions is one way to gain a deeper understanding of the problem.\nWorkshop goals tell participants how they will spend their brainpower during\nthe workshop. There are a few examples in the table on page 116.\nPreparing for the workshop might take a few days or even weeks. You should\nat least have draft business goals and architecturally significant requirements\nbefore starting.

We\u2019ll talk about specific activities we\ncan plug into this cycle in Choose Appropriate Design Activities, on page 119.\nCreate\nDuring the create step, participants work alone or in small groups to address\nworkshop goals by sketching and modeling their design ideas. Keeping it\nanalog works best during a workshop. Using pens or fat markers and paper\nencourages people to focus on ideas rather than precision. At this stage of\nthe game, you value ideas, not perfection.\nThe create step is always time boxed. Short workshops might spend only 5\u20137\nminutes in the create step. Longer workshops can allow for more time. Keep in\nmind that more time does not always lead to more or better ideas! Architecture\nexploration requires deep thought, so adjust time relative to your goals. Anything\nless than 5 minutes is not enough time for most software architecture topics.\nShare\nAfter everyone has created something, it\u2019s time to share it with the larger\ngroup. This step is sometimes called pitch, as in make a pitch for your idea.\nGive each group 3\u20135 minutes to share what they created and describe how\ntheir design satisfies the goal.

Feedback during the critique should focus\non the merits of the design relative to the workshop\u2019s goals. The idea is to lay\nthe foundation for a constructive dialogue.

Instead of a rapid-fire 90-minute workshop,\nthe design studio ended almost on time after a little more than two hours.\nProject Lionheart: The Story So Far\u2026\nThe team is at a crossroad. Some team members feel we should use a service-\noriented approach using microservices. Others feel we should play it safe and\nstick with a tried-and-true multi-tier pattern. You need to resolve the conflict\nand create buy-in for the design decision. Since either pattern would probably\nwork out fine, you host a design studio to help the team decide.\nYour goal for the workshop is to explore the nuances of each pattern and\nflush risks into the open for the team to discuss. You start the workshop with\nsmall-group exercises to generate ideas. The microservices and multi-tiered\npatterns come up, but a few other interesting and unexpected ideas are raised\nas well.\nAfter the initial round of presentations and critiques, you have us create\ngroup posters. Unexpectedly, as the team works through the different ideas,\nmicroservices fall completely out of favor! By the end of the two-hour work-\nshop, the team explored a half dozen design options and arrive at a great\nsolution. More importantly, everyone had a say in the final decision and there\nseems to be a genuine sense of shared ownership among the team that didn\u2019t\nexist before the workshop.\nNext Up\nA design studio is a fantastic method for quickly exploring ideas. Perhaps\neven more important is the journey your team takes to arrive at a decision.\nEveryone who participates has a stake in the design they helped create. A\nsense of shared ownership encourages greater autonomy and a sense of\nresponsibility. This shared ownership permeates all aspects of design from\ncode to architecture.\nCollaborative design workshops are a powerful tool, but as we\u2019ve seen so far,\nthere is more to architecture design than group work and sticky notes.

Many of the diagrams I see focus on the\ndecomposition of software into logical building blocks, although they usually do this\nat the expense of information about technology. After all, we\u2019ve been taught to keep\nthe \u201clogical view\u201d of a software system separate from the \u201cdevelopment view.\u201d Unfor-\ntunately, this tends to result in a collection of diagrams that make little sense when\nviewed individually, with neither diagram providing an accurate reflection of the code.\nOne solution is to merge the logical and development views of a software system, treating\nthe combined diagrams as a collection of zoomable maps on top of a code base. This is\nthe concept at the core of my C4 model\u2014a collection of diagrams that show varying levels\nof abstraction. A System Context diagram shows your software system and how it fits\ninto the environment around it, in terms of users and other software systems. A Container\ndiagram zooms into your system boundary to show how it\u2019s made up of containers\n(applications and data stores). A Component diagram zooms in to a particular container\nto show the components inside it. Optionally, a UML class diagram zooms into a partic-\nular component to show the code-level elements it\u2019s built from.\nAlthough UML is still useful, I prefer a simple boxes and lines notation to describe\nsoftware architecture. To avoid confusion, my advice is to keep the notation as simple\nand self-describing as possible, adding a key/legend where necessary. Finally, adding\nmore text to boxes is a great way to add information about responsibilities, providing\na nice, at-a-glance view and removing ambiguity from what is usually just a collection\nof named boxes.\nWe want the patterns to be visible in the diagrams we draw. We can accom-\nplish this in a variety of ways. Choose names that reflect the pattern. Create\nviews that highlight the patterns we\u2019ve selected. Arrange the elements so you\ncan see the pattern. Above all, use patterns as part of your vocabulary for\nsharing designs.\nStrive for Consistency and Simplicity\nEvery drop of ink in our diagrams means something. Color, shape, orientation,\nfont choice, and position convey meaning. Avoid superfluous details to help\nreaders focus on the ideas you want to share. Choose different colors or shapes\nto highlight different ideas, not simply to make the diagram look pretty.\nreport erratum  \u2022  discuss\nDraw Fantastic Diagrams \u2022 139\n", "page": 151, "type": "text", "section": "Page 151"}

{"text": "We need architecture descriptions for several important reasons.\nGet organized. Building software is as much about working with people as\nit is working with technology. Architecture descriptions show how every-\nthing comes together. Whether we are assigning responsibilities to teams\nor letting people self-organize, everyone needs to know how components\nin the system work together so they can align themselves accordingly.\nEstablish the lingua franca between technical and business stakeholders.\nEvery stakeholder has a right to understand the architecture. While\nmodels establish the vocabulary of design, the architecture description\ntranslates those models into ideas different stakeholders can understand.\nOne of the most important jobs of an architecture description is to show\nhow the business goals and quality attributes are addressed in the\narchitectural design decisions.\nPut a spotlight on quality attributes. Quality attributes are often out of sight\nand out of mind. The architecture is the one place we treat quality\nattributes as first-class citizens. Keep quality attributes at the front of\neveryone\u2019s mind by making the architecture a real thing that people can\nsee, read about, and talk about.\nClarify thinking. It\u2019s easy to believe you have everything figured out if nothing\nis written down. When you put pen to paper, you\u2019ll realize how mushy\nthe ideas in your head really are. Writing an architecture description\nforces us to confront our knowledge and come to terms with what we\nknow, what we think we know, and what we don\u2019t know.\nCreate something you can evaluate. We can\u2019t reason about things we can\u2019t\nsee, touch, or share. We also can\u2019t afford to wait for every design decision\nto be realized in code before critically evaluating it. Architecture descrip-\ntions give us a way to analyze our design decisions while it\u2019s easy to make\nchanges. Spending the afternoon explaining a dumb idea to someone is\nmuch better than spending a month implementing it.\nShow it off. Software architecture is cool! You poured your heart and soul\ninto designing a beautiful software system. The whole world should\nappreciate it! Architecture descriptions are the best way to brag about\nthe software systems you\u2019ve built. A good architecture description projects\nconfidence for customers and upper management.

The trick to getting the\nmost bang for the buck is to choose the appropriate description methods for\nyour current project and team context.\nMatch the Description Method to the Situation\nThere is no one-size-fits-all approach to creating software architecture descrip-\ntions. Less mature systems might change their architecture several times in a\nsingle conversation. A co-located team working on a smaller system can get by\nwith whiteboards and storytelling. A system built for a regulated industry may\nbe legally required to document design decisions in a specific way.\nThere are two questions we need to answer to decide how to document our\narchitecture. How likely are our design decisions to change? And how far\nmust we share our design decisions? Depending on how you answer these\nquestions, you\u2019ll arrive at one of four types of description methods: tribal,\ncommunal, formal, or wasteful.\nDifficult to Change\nEasy to Change\nDifficult to \nShare\nEasy to \nShare\nWhich architecture description approach should I use?\nWaste of Time\nTribal\nFormal\nCommunal\n(Start here)\n(Avoid this)\n(Evolve to this)\n(Go here only \nwhen it s required)\nCreate an Oral History with Tribal Methods\nTribal description methods rely heavily on oral tradition and cultural artifacts.\nStorytelling, metaphors, and informal sketching are all examples of tribal\narchitecture descriptions.

As a rule of thumb, if you find yourself telling the same\nstory to more than a few people, then it\u2019s time to evolve the style of architecture\ndescription to increase reach. Enter communal methods.\nCommunal architecture description methods are shared by the community,\nnot just individuals of the tribe. Architecture haiku (Activity 21, Architecture\nHaiku, on page 263), architecturally evident coding styles (described on page\n107), and architecture decision records (Activity 20, Architecture Decision\nRecords, on page 260) are all examples of communal description methods.\nCommunal descriptions are still easy to change, but they are also easy to\nshare compared to tribal methods.\nMost teams will evolve from tribal descriptions to communal descriptions\nnaturally as the architecture matures and the rate of change decreases.\nCommunal description methods are good enough for many teams. In some\nsituations, we want something more permanent. We can get this permanence\nwith formal architecture descriptions.\nInvest in Formal Descriptions Only When Required\nFormal description methods include traditional architecture description\ndocuments and formal models. These tend to be larger documents and require\nmore effort to create. Formal models (the sort that defines the architecture\nwith a mathematical model) require a higher degree of accuracy and precision.\nHigh-risk systems or architecture decisions requiring a high degree of coordi-\nnation are good candidates for formal description methods. Depending on\nyour industry, you may be required to create a formal document.

After the architecture starts to coalesce, if desired (or when\na stakeholder asks for it), create a traditional document.\nCreate a Traditional Software Architecture Description\nThe traditional software architecture description, or SAD, is a classic design\ndocument that every architect should know how to write.

It takes a lot of effort for you to infer how things work and\nyou probably make mistakes.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way. You can organize your code as a story at many levels\nso that it makes sense and tells a story as you zoom in or out. Consider what you\nate yesterday evening. You recognize it as dinner, and zooming in you also recognize\ncourses, then dishes, then ingredients.\nThe levels help you think clearly. If you\u2019re wondering how long dinner will last,\nthinking about the number of courses is helpful and thinking about allergies is best\ndone by ingredients. But the reverse doesn\u2019t help at all.\nPeople have been thinking about dinner for a lot longer than software, so it\u2019s already\nbaked into our language. You will have to invent your story and levels, though you\ncan lean on developers who have come before you. Architecture patterns give you\ngeneral names to use like connectors and layers, and specific ones like reduce stage\nand broker.\nYour story at many levels won\u2019t come for free, so you will spend time gardening, making\nminor refactorings as you go so that the story stays clear.

As with most things, a stitch in time saves nine, plus\nit makes you look like you knew what you were doing the whole time.\nIt\u2019s easy to focus your attention on the source code only, but the system\u2019s runtime\ndeserves similar attention, as does how it is allocated to hardware or containers. If\nyou want to think about it clearly, structure it as a story at many levels.\nThink about your stakeholders and what they value. What are their roles and\nresponsibilities on the project? How do they like to process information? How\nwill this person use the information you give them?

New teammates might be overwhelmed by the\nexisting documentation and could benefit with some help getting started. At\na minimum, architecture descriptions should describe design decisions, design\nrationale, and structures in the design.\nHow we organize this information is important too.

Viewpoints can also\nbe constructed to satisfy specific stakeholder needs. Here are a few examples:\n\u2022 A scalability, security, or maintainability viewpoint will demonstrate how\nthe architecture satisfies specific quality attribute scenarios.\n\u2022 A regulatory viewpoint might provide a particular stakeholder group con-\ncerned with regulatory requirements information needed to perform an\naudit.\n\u2022 A teachability viewpoint or welcome to the team viewpoint might walk a\nnew teammate through your architecture and development practices with\nthe goal of getting them to commit code on day one.\n\u2022 A business impact viewpoint might show how different parts of the archi-\ntecture contribute business value.\nViewpoints are a must in traditional architecture descriptions. With tribal\nand communal approaches, create viewpoints opportunistically and keep\nthem lightweight. For example, once there are several ADRs in your code\nrepository, create a viewpoint page that connects decision records together\nto provide overarching context. Mountains of documentation are not required\nto organize architecture descriptions for human consumption.

An unavoidable and obvious\nrequest in these engagements is \u201cShow me your architecture.\u201d Over the years, based\non the responses I get, I\u2019ve developed a personal catalog of misconceptions about\narchitecture and architecting.\nA printout of all of the sequence diagrams for all the use case scenarios you thought\nof so far is not your architecture! While the collection of all your use cases and\ntheir behavioral traces, such as those you capture in sequence diagrams, are\nuseful and important to your system, they do not provide the right level of\nabstraction to reason about classes of behavior of the system.\nCode review can not replace an architecture review! The bottom line of any archi-\ntecting effort is to design and implement a system that meets its business and\nstakeholder goals. Working code is the inevitable reality. However, architectural\nconcerns cross-cut many elements in the implemented system. An effective\narchitecture review is bound by those architecturally significant requirements\nand all the elements they touch. Traditional code review practices do not cover\nthis end-to-end perspective.\nBoxes are not the only architectural elements! In cases when a team does have an\nartifact, often called the Software Architecture Document, and sadly referred to\nas SAD, the document contain depictions of ad hoc box-and-line drawings. This\nis a great start, but discussions are long on the boxes while the lines are com-\npletely forgotten. This is unfortunate because many times the lines carry the\nmost critical aspects of the architectural decisions.\nOf these three misconceptions, the most significant one is to appreciate the importance\nof lines in software architecture diagrams. Think about it. If you aim to increase\nperformance, then you focus on the frequency and volume of the inter-element com-\nmunications. If you want to increase modifiability, you limit interactions between\nelements. If you want to optimize security, you protect the inter-element relationships.\nAll of these are represented by the lines!\nMany architectural decisions are carried on those thin, often forgotten lines. Since\nso many architectural decisions are carried by the inter-element relationships, one\nof my first recommendations to teams is to get a better understanding of the relation-\nships between the elements.

For\nexample, if we want reviewers to focus on a specific quality attribute, then\nthe artifacts should include views relevant to that quality attribute.

One reviewer may\nconclude the architecture is a masterpiece whereas another proclaims it a\ndumpster fire. A design rubric defines the criteria reviewers should use when\njudging the fitness of the architecture.\nRubrics consist of two parts. Criteria describe the characteristics used to\nevaluate the design artifacts. Ratings describe the scale used to interpret the\ncharacteristics. Typically, rubrics take the shape of a matrix.\nIn the example on page 163 from Project Lionheart we\u2019re using quality attribute\nscenarios as the criteria, listed on the left. On the right, reviewers enter their\nratings using the provided scale, which is described at the bottom.\nLet\u2019s explore how we arrived at this rubric and define some general advice for\ncreating rubrics.\nSelect Criteria Based on Architecturally Significant Requirements\nArchitecturally significant requirements define the software\u2019s purpose from\na stakeholder\u2019s perspective.

The sooner you start testing your designs, the\nsooner you\u2019ll be able to improve them. Better still, make evaluation a regular\npart of your development routine.\nThere are dozens of opportunities every day to confirm (or amend) design\ndecisions. Every day we walk through the architecture and tell stories about\nhow it promotes quality attributes. We submit code for peer review. We pair\nprogram as a regular part of our everyday workflow.\nBalance Cost and Value with the Evaluation Pyramid\nThe test pyramid is a concept introduced by Mike Cohn in Succeeding with\nAgile: Software Development Using Scrum [Coh09]. The premise is straightfor-\nward. Different kinds of tests find different kinds of defects, but some tests\nare easier to create and maintain than others. The test pyramid proposes that\nthe majority of tests should be fast to run and cheap to maintain unit tests.\nSince unit tests can\u2019t catch everything, we should also create a small number\nof slow, brittle full-stack integration tests.\nThe premise behind the evaluation pyramid is similar to the test pyramid.\nThe vast majority of architecture evaluations should be fast and cheap quick\nchecks. Quick checks won\u2019t find every kind of design issue so we\u2019ll also want\nto perform a few thorough but costly deep evaluations. To provide for some\nconsistency between quick checks and deep evaluations, we can perform\ntargeted evaluations.\nDays\nMinutes\nMore issues, \nbroader scope\nFewer issues, \nnarrower scope\nDeep \nEvaluations\nTargeted Evaluations\nQuick Checks\nreport erratum  \u2022  discuss\nEvaluate Early, Evaluate Often, Evaluate Continuously \u2022 171\n", "page": 182, "type": "text", "section": "Page 182"}

In response to these new technologies, emerging architecture patterns\nsuch as microservices and function-as-a-service assume developers have a\ngreater awareness of how their decisions influence quality attributes and\nother system properties.\nOn modern software systems, there is little difference between a developer\nand an architect. This isn\u2019t to say that modern software development teams\ndon\u2019t have technical leaders. They do, though today\u2019s software architects don\u2019t\nalways self-identify as architects.

When things are going well, architects look more like coaches or\nmentors than authoritative leaders who make all the design decisions.

If you have a meeting to talk to stakeholders\nabout quality attributes, take a teammate with you. Ask a teammate to review\na document filled with decisions before you share it with the whole team.\nCreate Scaffolding\nIn education theory, instructional scaffolding refers to support structures\ngiven to individual students to promote and reinforce learning. In school, you\nlikely experienced many scaffolding techniques such as detailed feedback on\na test, handouts, rubrics, and homework templates.

Imposing\nthis constraint might make development easier and help you avoid simple\nmistakes.\nHost Information Sessions\nIf your team is keen on software architecture, consider hosting information\nsessions so you can dive deep into specific topics. Always be prepared to teach\nrelevant information just-in-time before the knowledge is required to be\napplied. Dozens of micro-lessons are just as good as a single long training\nsession.\nAs the team\u2019s skills increase, they\u2019ll start to share more feedback about the\narchitecture\u2019s design.

Our goal is to give\naway as much design authority as possible without putting essential quality\nattributes at risk or otherwise endangering the architecture. In Management\n3.0: Leading Agile Developers, Developing Agile Leaders [App11], Jurgen\nAppelo describes seven levels of authority. We can use these levels to help us\ndecide how much design authority to keep and what we can leave to the team.\nLevel 1: Tell You make the design decision and tell the team what will happen,\nusually by producing an artifact.\nLevel 2: Sell You make the design decision and show the team why it is the\nright call.\nLevel 3: Consult You ask the team for input before making the design deci-\nsion. Ultimately the decision is still yours.\nLevel 4: Agree You collaborate with your team and reach consensus about\nthe design decision as a group.

In this\ncapacity, you might help gather information as a facilitator but someone\nelse is responsible for the decision.\nThe level of authority you use will vary from decision to decision and team to\nteam. Delegate the right level of design authority for the situation and you\u2019ll\nincrease the team\u2019s confidence, happiness, and agility. Delegate too little\ndesign authority and you may undermine trust and make some people feel\nmicromanaged. Delegate too much design authority and you\u2019ll end up with\nan anxious, unhappy team and a poor design.\nIn the best case, when you delegate too much design authority to a team that\nis not ready to handle it you\u2019ll have to try again at a lower authority level.\nWhen the team fails under these circumstances, it undermines trust and\ncreates waste through rework, assuming you catch the decision early enough.\nAlthough that situation is not ideal, you can still recover. In the worst case,\na bad design decision might go unnoticed until it\u2019s too late to recover easily.\nChoosing the appropriate level of design authority is not an exact science. It\ntakes some trial and error to figure out how your team likes to operate. The\neasiest way to check that you\u2019re choosing the best level of authority is to talk\nit over with your team and decide together.\nWhen to Keep Design Authority\nWhen the risks of failure are high, it\u2019s better to be conservative with how\nmuch authority you delegate. Stick to the first three delegation levels when\nthe team is inexperienced. This approach is proven to work and improves\nyour chances of producing a useful design. Unfortunately, the first three\ndelegation levels don\u2019t come with as many bonus multipliers in quality, hap-\npiness, speed, and agility.\nSimultaneously designing an architecture and skilling up a team is one of\nthe most challenging times to be an architect.

Amongst their many responsibilities, an architect aims\nto reduce technical risk, plan for future change, and ensure that systems meet their\nquality attributes. However, for an architect to be truly successful, they also need to\nact like a technical leader.\nEffective architects cannot always rely on their authority to make decisions. In today\u2019s\never-changing technology landscape, it\u2019s impossible for an architect to know all the\ndetails about the latest tools and technologies and how to apply them well. Instead,\nthe effective architect must draw upon the wider experience of their development\nteam and organisation. As a technical leader, the architect builds a shared technical\nvision for the team and focuses on amplifying the effectiveness and growing the\nskillsets of team members.\nIf architects are measured by the quality of decisions, they should also be interested\nin helping developers make better decisions. After all, each line of code represents a\nchoice and, ultimately, each choice is a decision that has been made. The architect\ncan improve developers\u2019 decision making by articulating operational or environmental\nconstraints and agreeing with the team on architectural principles to gently guide\nfuture decisions.\nEach of these activities\u2014building a technical vision, describing constraints, and\napplying architectural principles\u2014requires completely different nontechnical skills.\nThese skills, often classified as \u201csoft skills,\u201d are often the hardest to build. To be\nsuccessful in this role, architects should draw upon deep communication skills\nsuch as explaining technical ideas in non-technical terms, using diagrams and\nmodels to build a common understanding and telling stories to motivate, excite,\nand challenge team members. Another essential leadership skill worth developing\nis the ability to listen. Not only will good listening skills improve the knowledge of\nthe architect, but they will also grow the commitment of the team and organisation\nto the final technical vision.\nThose architects who solely focus on deep technical expertise and owning all technical\ndecisions are destined to build and live in their own ivory tower.

In What Software Archi-\ntects Do, on page 3 you learned how software architects go about this task,\nand we\u2019ve expanded on these ideas throughout the book.\nLet\u2019s revisit the architect\u2019s key responsibilities from the perspective of our\nnew knowledge:\nDefine the problem from an engineering perspective. Architects are respon-\nsible for defining the architecturally significant requirements, especially\nquality attributes. We prefer to use human-centered design methods to\ngather these requirements so we don\u2019t lose touch with stakeholders\u2019 true\nneeds.\nPartition the system and assign responsibilities to elements and teams.\nArchitects guide the team to identify patterns that will promote desired\nquality attributes. We prefer to minimally design the architecture to ensure\nkey quality attributes are achieved, leaving all other decisions to down-\nstream designers.\nKeep an eye on the bigger picture and ensure design consistency of the\nwhole. Architects monitor the design as it emerges and shepherd the team\nas they implement the architecture. We strive to capture design decisions\nas accurate models using the lightest-weight documentation methods\nthat work for the team and stakeholders. We use these models to reason\nabout the system, evaluate our decisions, and identify risks in our ability\nto achieve business goals.\nreport erratum  \u2022  discuss\nDesign Architecture Together \u2022 185\n", "page": 196, "type": "text", "section": "Page 196"}

Architects deal with the reality of shipping software\nby identifying technical debt and devising strategies for paying it back.\nWe recognize that technical debt is an unavoidable consequence of success\nand work to manage debt strategically over the life of the software system.\nGrow the team\u2019s architecture skills. Architects empower their teams to take\nownership of the system by ensuring the team has the knowledge and\nskills required to understand, explore, make, and evaluate an architecture.\nWe prefer to design the architecture with our team instead of designing\nthe architecture for our team.\nFor many teams programming is the easy part. Understanding what the\nproblem is and deciding how the broader system comes together to solve that\nproblem can be tough. The better everyone understands the architecture, the\nmore prepared your team will be to tackle the challenges of software develop-\nment. Designing the system together creates this deeper understanding.\nProject Lionheart: The Epic Conclusion\nMayor van Damme is pleased. We completed the project only a few weeks\nbehind our original schedule despite the constant stream of changes that\noccurred nearly from the start. We satisfied all the high-priority quality\nattributes, though there were a few hiccups during load testing before the\nofficial public release. Other than that everything went well.\nThe team strongly feels that the foundation provided by our architecture made\nit all possible. Our decision to do less architecture design up front worked\nout fine. The team had prior experience with most of the frameworks and\ntechnologies we used. In the beginning, we focused on the areas of greatest\nrisk and worked to build consensus around the architecture. We had a few\nlucky breaks, such as stumbling upon a major problem with two web services,\nbut we found the problems early enough that we had time to rewrite them\nfrom scratch. The final iterations of the project were stressful but not\nunbearably so.\nOur last official work on Project Lionheart is to create maintenance documen-\ntation for the city\u2019s IT department. The team is writing a moth ball document,\na user\u2019s guide, and cleaned-up versions of relevant architecture views.

{"text": "The mini-QAW is a very useful workshop with a few moving parts. Next, we\u2019ll\nlook at some additional tips for each of the stages in the standard agenda.\nBrainstorm and Prioritize Raw Scenarios\nIf workshop participants are relatively experienced, guide them through a\nsimple brainstorming exercise. Set a time limit of 7\u201310 minutes for brainstorm-\ning and have participants work alone to come up with as many raw scenarios\nas they can. With less experienced participants (or facilitators), consider using\nthe quality attribute web activity on page 207 with a prepared taxonomy and\nquality attribute taxonomy-based questionnaire. The taxonomy questionnaire\nis a list of questions based on a predefined quality attribute taxonomy designed\nto prompt stakeholders to think about potential scenarios. Questionnaires\nrequire more up-front work, but this approach is thorough and produces\nmore consistent results than brainstorming without a questionnaire.\nAfter brainstorming, prioritize the raw scenarios. Stakeholders will raise many\nconcerns during a workshop, but not all concerns are worth the effort to refine\nfurther. After participants have finished voting, take a step back and look at\nthe web. Are there areas of the web with a greater number of sticky notes\nthan others? How does that compare with how people voted? Were the high-\npriority scenarios aligned with the high-priority quality attributes?\nThe example on page 214, is what the quality attribute web might look like\nafter voting. Dots on sticky notes are a vote for a raw scenario whereas dots\non the web are for the overall quality attribute regardless of the specific sce-\nnarios identified.\nStart Scenario Refinement\nAfter prioritizing raw scenarios, use the time remaining in the workshop to\nrefine scenarios as a group. Show the quality attribute scenario template\nduring the workshop and fill it in with stakeholders. The template can be\nprinted on paper or shown as a presentation. The facilitator is responsible\nfor refining any remaining scenarios as homework before the next meeting.\nAs you refine scenarios, keep an eye out for functional requirements mas-\nquerading as quality attribute scenarios. Everyone loves to talk about features,\nand it\u2019s easy for feature requests to come up during a QAW. When this hap-\npens, add the feature request to your notebook and redirect the conversation\nback toward specific quality attributes.\nreport erratum  \u2022  discuss\nMini-Quality Attribute Workshop \u2022 213\n", "page": 222, "type": "text", "section": "Page 222"}

Finding\nissues is a good thing.\n\u2022 To keep the meeting moving, the time spent on each scenario should be\ntime boxed.\n\u2022 Avoid problem solving during the review. The purpose of this activity is\nto surface issues, not solve them.\n\u2022 The reader and recorder roles can be combined but should be separate\nfrom the architect role.\n\u2022 Rotate roles to help build teammates\u2019 skills.\n\u2022 Write or project the current the quality attribute scenario so reviewers\ncan see it during the walkthrough. If this is not practical, distribute a\npacket with quality attribute scenarios.\n\u2022 Record new quality attribute scenarios raised during the walkthrough.\nExample\nLet\u2019s walk through an availability scenario from Project Lionheart. A user\u2019s\nsearches for open RFPs and receives a list of available RFPs 99 percent of the\ntime on average over the course of the year. To walk through an availability\nscenario we\u2019ll need to focus on specific conditions.

{"text": "Activity 38\nSketch and Compare\nSometimes a design only seems good because there isn\u2019t a baseline for com-\nparison. With the sketch and compare activity, we create two or more alterna-\ntives of the same design so it\u2019s easier to see the pros and cons.\nAny design alternatives can be sketched and compared. This includes current\nand future, ideal and reality, technology A and technology B, and many others.\nSketching the extremes can also be compared. To do this, pick a quality\nattribute or design concept and design the architecture for that one thing at\nthe exclusion of all else. Then pick another high-priority quality attribute or\ninteresting design concept and sketch an alternative design for comparison.\nBenefits\n\u2022 Expose both the positive and negative aspects of a decision by comparing\nit to something else.\n\u2022 Create a platform for discussion and build consensus around a design\ndecision.\n\u2022 Avoid buyer\u2019s remorse when making a design decision by doing at least\na basic comparison.\nActivity Timing\n20\u201330 minutes, up to an hour\nParticipants\nThis activity works best in small groups of 3\u20135 people, including the architect\nand other stakeholders.\nPreparation and Materials\n\u2022 Whiteboard or flipchart, markers\n\u2022 Alternatively, prepared views (for example, in slide software), projector\nreport erratum  \u2022  discuss\nSketch and Compare \u2022 311\n", "page": 317, "type": "text", "section": "Page 317"}
