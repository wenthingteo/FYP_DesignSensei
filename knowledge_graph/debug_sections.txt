Design Principles 1 Previous Code Convention Discussions  Style  What does the code look like? Is it consistent, scalable, and maintainable? Appearance, format, readability  Naming  How are we describing the identifiers in our code? Are they understandable? Do the names reflect purposeresponsibility? Program comprehension 2 SOLID Principles for Object-Oriented Design  Five basic principles (guidelines) for Object-Oriented Design (OOD)  Results in systems that are:  Easy to maintain  Easy to extend  SOLID is a guide for:  Creating designs from scratch  Improving existing designs 3 SOILD Principles  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  Openclosed Principle (OCP) Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) 4 Single Responsibility Principle  Every class should have A SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY  The responsibility of a class drives its need to change  Responsibility should

PRINCIPLES OF SOFTWARE DESIGN F. Tip and M. Weintraub Thanks go to Andreas Zeller for allowing incorporation of his materials THE CHALLENGE 1. Software may live much longer than expected 2. Software must be continuously adapted to a changing environment 3. Maintenance takes 5080 of the cost Goal: Make software maintainable and reusable  at little or no cost USE THE PRINCIPLES OF OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL 1. Abstraction 2. Encapsulation 3. Modularity 4. Hierarchy Goal: Maintainability and Reusability PRINCIPLES OF OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN 1. Abstraction 2. Encapsulation 3. Modularity 4. Hierarchy ABSTRACTION Concrete Object General Principle ABSTRACTION 1. Highlights common properties of objects 2. Distinguishes important and unimportant properties 3. Must be understood even without a concrete object ABSTRACTION An abstraction denotes the essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from all other kinds

Robert C. Martin Copyright (c) 2000 by Robert C. Martin. All Rights Reserved. www.objectmentor.com 1 Design Principles and Design Patterns Robert C. Martin www.objectmentor.com What is software architecture? The answer is multitiered. At the highest level, there are the architecture patterns that define the overall shape and structure of software applications1. Down a level is the architecture that is specifically related to the pur- pose of the software application. Yet another level down resides the architecture of the modules and their interconnections. This is the domain of design patterns2, pack- akges, components, and classes. It is this level that we will concern ourselves with in this chapter. Our scope in this chapter is quite limitted. There is much more to be said about the principles and patterns that are exposed here. Interested readers are referred to Martin99. Architecture and Dependencies What goes wrong with softw

Software Design Basics Software design is a process to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation. For assessing user requirements, an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document is created whereas for coding and implementation, there is a need of more specific and detailed requirements in software terms. The output of this process can directly be used into implementation in programming languages. Software design is the first step in SDLC (Software Design Life Cycle), which moves the concentration from problem domain to solution domain. It tries to specify how to fulfill the requirements mentioned in SRS. Software Design Levels Software design yields three levels of results:  Architectural Design - The architectural design is the highest abstract version of the system. It identifies the software as a system with many components interacting with each o

Principles of Software Design This paper presents fundamental principles of effective software design. If consistently applied, they help us to achieve simple, understandable, and robust software designs. They provide criteria for choosing between various design alternatives. All design decisions should be evaluated against them to ensure their consistent application. These principles also provide a framework for evaluating the quality of software designs created by others. Goals of Software Design Software design is primarily about managing complexity. Software systems are often very complex and have many moving parts. Most systems must support dozens of features simultaneously. Each feature by itself might not seem very complicated. However, when faced with the task of creating one coherent structure that supports all of the required functionality at once, things become complicated very quickly. Human capacity to deal with compl
