{"text": "Preface: This book isn't an introduction to object-oriented technology or design. Many books\nalready do a good job of that. This book assumes you are reasonably proficient in at least\none object-oriented programming language, and you should have some experience in\nobject-oriented design as well. You definitely shouldn't have to rush to the nearest\ndictionary the moment we mention \"types\" and \"polymorphism,\" or \"interface\" as\nopposed to \"implementation\" inheritance. On the other hand, this isn't an advanced technical treatise either. It's a book of design\npatterns that describes simple and elegant solutions to specific problems in object-\noriented software design. Design patterns capture solutions that have developed and\nevolved over time. Hence they aren't the designs people tend to generate initially. They\nreflect untold redesign and receding as developers have struggled for greater reuse \nand flexibility in their software. Design patterns capture these solutions in a succinct\nand easily applied form. The design patterns require neither unusual language features nor amazing program-\nming tricks with which to astound your friends and managers. All can be implemented \nin standard object-oriented languages, though they might take a little more work than\nad hoc \nsolutions. But the extra effort invariably pays dividends in increased flexibility\nand reusability. Once you understand the design patterns and have had an \"Aha!\" (and not just a\n\"Huh?\") experience with them, you won't ever think about object-oriented design in\nthe same way. You'll have insights that can make your own designs more flexible,\nmodular, reusable, and understandable\u2014which is why you're interested in object-\noriented technology in the first place, right? A word of warning and encouragement: Don't worry if you don't understand this\nbook completely on the first reading. We didn't understand it all on the first writing! Remember that this isn't a book to read once and put on a shelf. We \nhope you'll find\nyourself referring to it again and again for design insights and for inspiration. This book has had a long gestation. It has seen four countries, three of its authors'\nmarriages, and the birth of two (unrelated) offspring. Many people have had a part\nin its development. Special thanks are due Bruce Anderson, Kent Beck, and Andre\nWeinand for their inspiration and advice. We also thank those who reviewed drafts", "domains": ["Software Quality Attributes", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 15", "position": 15, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 377}
{"text": "Guide to Readers: This book has two main parts. The first part (Chapters 1 and 2) describes what design\npatterns are and how they help you design object-oriented software. It includes a design\ncase study that demonstrates how design patterns apply in practice. The second part\nof the book (Chapters 3,4, and 5) is a catalog of the actual design patterns. The catalog makes up the majority of the book. Its chapters divide the design patterns\ninto three types: creational, structural, and behavioral. You can use the catalog hi several\nways. You \ncan read the catalog from start to finish, or you can just browse from pattern \nto pattern. Another approach is to study one of the chapters. That will help you see\nhow closely related patterns distinguish themselves. You can use the references between the patterns as a logical route through the catalog. This approach will give you insight into how patterns relate to each other, how they can\nbe combined with other patterns, and which patterns work well together. Figure 1.1\n(page 12) \ndepicts these references graphically. Yet another way to read the catalog is to use a more problem-directed approach. Skip\nto Section 1.6 (page 24) to read about some common problems hi designing reusable\nobject-oriented software; then read the patterns that address these problems. Some\npeople read the catalog through first and then use a problem-directed approach to\napply the patterns to their projects. If you aren't an experienced object-oriented designer, then start with the simplest and\nmost common patterns:\n\u2022 Abstract Factory (page 87) \n\u2022 Factory Method (107)\n\u2022 Adapter (139) \n\u2022 Observer (293)\n\u2022 Composite (163) \n\u2022 Strategy (315)\n\u2022 Decorator (175) \n\u2022 Template Method (325)\nIt's hard to find an object-oriented system that doesn't use at least a couple of these\npatterns, and large systems use nearly all of them.

{"text": "and \"decorate objects so you can easily add/remove features.\" Once you know the: pattern, a lot of design decisions follow automatically. We all know the value of design experience. How many times have you had design deja-\nvu\u2014that feeling that you've solved a problem before \nbut not knowing exactly where or\nhow? If you could remember the details of the previous problem and how you solved\nit, then you could reuse the experience instead of rediscovering it. However, we don't\ndo a good job of recording experience in software design for others to use. The purpose of this book is to record experience in designing object-oriented software as\ndesign patterns. Each design pattern systematically names, explains, and evaluates an\nimportant and recurring design in object-oriented systems. Our goal is to capture design\nexperience in a form that people can use effectively. To this end we have documented\nsome of the most important design patterns and present them as a catalog. Design patterns make it easier to reuse successful designs and architectures. Expressing\nproven techniques as design patterns makes them more accessible to developers of\nnew systems. Design patterns help you choose design alternatives that make a system\nreusable and avoid alternatives that compromise reusability. Design patterns can even\nimprove the documentation and maintenance of existing systems by furnishing an\nexplicit specification of class and object interactions and their underlying intent. Put\nsimply, design patterns help a designer get a design \"right\" faster. None of the design patterns in this book describes new or unproven designs. We have\nincluded only designs that have been applied more than once in different systems. Most\nof these designs have never been documented before. They are either part of the folklore\nof the object-oriented community or are elements of some successful object-oriented\nsystems\u2014neither of which is easy for novice designers to learn from. So although these\ndesigns aren't new, we capture them in a new and accessible way: as a catalog of design\npatterns having a consistent format. Despite the book's size, the design patterns in it capture only a fraction of what an expert\nmight know. It doesn't have any patterns dealing with concurrency or distributed pro-\ngramming or real-time programming. It doesn't have any application domain-specific\npatterns. It doesn't tell you how to build user interfaces, how to write device drivers,\nor how to use an object-oriented database.", "domains": ["Software Quality Attributes", "Domain-Driven Design", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 22", "position": 22, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 395}
{"text": "SECTION 1.1: WHAT IS A DESIGN PATTERN? 3\nand doors, but at the core of both kinds of patterns is a solution to a problem in a\ncontext. In general, a pattern has four essential elements:\n1. The pattern name is a handle we can use to describe a design problem, its so-\nlutions, and consequences in a word or two. Naming a pattern immediately\nincreases our design vocabulary. It lets us design at a higher level of abstraction. Having a vocabulary for patterns lets us talk about them with our colleagues,\nin our documentation, and even to ourselves. It makes it easier to think about\ndesigns and to communicate them and their trade-offs to others. Finding good \nnames has been one of the hardest parts of developing our catalog. 2. The \nproblem describes when to apply the pattern. It explains the problem and its\ncontext. It might describe specific design problems such as how to represent algo-\nrithms as objects. It might describe class or object structures that are symptomatic\nof an inflexible design. Sometimes the problem will include a list of conditions\nthat must be met before it makes sense to apply the pattern. 3. The \nsolution describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships,\nresponsibilities, and collaborations. The solution doesn't describe a particular\nconcrete design or implementation, because a pattern is like a template that can\nbe applied in many different situations. Instead, the pattern provides an abstract\ndescription of a design problem and how a general arrangement of elements\n(classes and objects in our case) solves it. 4. The consequences are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern. Though\nconsequences are often unvoiced when we describe design decisions, they are\ncritical for evaluating design alternatives and for understanding the costs and\nbenefits of applying the pattern. The consequences for software often concern space and time trade-offs. They\nmay address language and implementation issues as well. Since reuse is often a\nfactor in object-oriented design, the consequences of a pattern include its impact\non a system's flexibility, extensibility, or portability. Listing these consequences\nexplicitly helps you understand and evaluate them. Point of view affects one's interpretation of what is and isn't a pattern. One person's\npattern can be another person's primitive building block. For \nthis book we have \nconcen-\ntrated on patterns at a certain level of abstraction.", "domains": ["Software Quality Attributes"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 23", "position": 23, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 394}
{"text": "and the distribution of responsibilities. Each design pattern focuses on a particular: object-oriented design problem or issue. It describes when it applies, whether it can be\napplied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of its\nuse. Since we must eventually implement our designs, a design pattern also provides\nsample C++ and (sometimes) \nSmalltalk code to illustrate an implementation. Although design patterns describe object-oriented designs, they are based on practical\nsolutions that have been implemented in mainstream object-oriented programming\nlanguages like Smalltalk \nand C++ rather than procedural languages (Pascal, C, Ada) or\nmore dynamic object-oriented languages (CLOS, Dylan, Self). We chose Smalltalk and\nC++ for pragmatic reasons: Our day-to-day experience has been in these languages,\nand they are increasingly popular. The choice of programming language is important because it influences one's point\nof view. Our patterns assume Smalltalk/C++-level language features, and that choice \ndetermines what can and cannot be implemented easily. If we assumed procedural\nlanguages, we might have included design patterns called \"Inheritance,\" \"Encapsu-\nlation,\" and \"Polymorphism.\" Similarly, some of our patterns are supported directly\nby the less common object-oriented languages. CLOS has multi-methods, for example,\nwhich lessen the need for a pattern such as Visitor (page 331). In fact, there are enough\ndifferences between Smalltalk and C++ to mean that some patterns can be expressed\nmore easily in one language than the other. (See Iterator (257) \nfor an example.) 1.2 Design Patterns in Smalltalk MVC\nThe Model/View/Controller (MVC) triad of classes [KP88] is used to build user inter-\nfaces in Smalltalk-80. Looking at the design patterns inside MVC should help you see\nwhat we mean by the term \"pattern.\" MVC consists of three kinds of objects. The Model is the application object, the View is\nits screen presentation, and the Controller defines the way the user interface reacts to\nuser input. Before MVC, user interface designs tended to lump these objects together. MVC decouples them to increase flexibility and reuse. MVC decouples views and models by establishing a subscribe/notify protocol between\nthem. A view must ensure that its appearance reflects the state of the model. Whenever\nthe model's data changes, the model notifies views that depend on it. In response, each\nview gets an opportunity to update itself. This approach lets you attach multiple views\nto a model to provide different presentations. You \ncan also create new views for a model\nwithout rewriting it. The following diagram shows a model and three views.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 24", "position": 24, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 409}
{"text": "model: Taken at face value, this example \nreflects a design that decouples views from models. But\nthe design is applicable to a more general problem: decoupling objects so that changes\nto one can affect any number of others without requiring the changed object to know \ndetails of the others. This more general design is described by the Observer (page 293)\ndesign pattern. Another feature of MVC is that views can be nested. For example, a control panel of\nbuttons might be implemented as a complex view containing nested button views. The\nuser interface for an object inspector can consist of nested views that may be reused in\na debugger. MVC supports nested views with the CompositeView class, a subclass of\nView. CompositeView objects act just like View objects; a composite view can be used\nwherever a view can be used, but it also contains and manages nested views. Again, we could think of this as a design that lets us treat a composite view just like\nwe treat one of its components. But the design is applicable to a more general problem,\nwhich occurs whenever we want to group objects and treat the group like an individual\nobject. This more general design is described by the Composite (163) design pattern. It\nlets you create a class hierarchy in which some subclasses define primitive objects (e.g.,\nButton) and other classes define composite objects (CompositeView) that assemble the\nprimitives into more complex objects. MVC also lets you change the way a view responds to user input without changing its\nvisual presentation. You might want to change the way it responds to the keyboard, for\nexample, or have it use a pop-up menu instead of command keys. MVC encapsulates\nthe response mechanism in a Controller object.

{"text": "A view uses an instance of a Controller subclass to implement a particular response: strategy; to implement a different strategy, simply replace the instance with a different\nkind of controller. It's even possible to change a view's controller at run-time to let the\nview change the way it responds to user input. For example, a view can be disabled so\nthat it doesn't accept input simply by giving it a controller that ignores input events. The View-Controller relationship is an example of the Strategy (315) design pattern. A Strategy is an object that represents an algorithm. It's useful when you want to\nreplace the algorithm either statically or dynamically, when you have a lot of variants\nof the algorithm, or when the algorithm has complex data structures that you want to\nencapsulate. MVC uses other design patterns, such as Factory Method (107) to specify the default\ncontroller class for a view and Decorator (175) to add scrolling to a view.

Graphical \nnotations, while important and useful,\naren't sufficient. They simply capture the end product of the design process as rela-\ntionships between classes and objects. To reuse the design, we must also record the\ndecisions, alternatives, and trade-offs that led to it. Concrete examples are important \ntoo, because they help you see the design in action. We describe design patterns using a consistent format. Each pattern is divided into\nsections according to the following template. The template lends a uniform structure\nto the information, \nmaking design patterns easier to learn, compare, and use.

Builder (97) Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so\nthat the same construction process can create different representations. Chain of Responsibility (223) Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by\ngiving more than one object a chance to handle the request.

We classify design patterns by two criteria (Table 1.1). The first criterion, called purpose,\nreflects what a pattern does. Patterns can have either creational, structural, or \nbehav-\nioral purpose. Creational patterns concern the process of object creation. Structural\npatterns deal with the composition of classes or objects. Behavioral patterns character-\nize the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility. The second criterion, called scope, specifies whether the pattern applies primarily to\nclasses or to objects. Class patterns deal with relationships between classes and their\nsubclasses. These relationships are established through inheritance, so they are static\u2014\nfixed at compile-time. Object patterns deal with object relationships, which can be\nchanged at run-time and are more dynamic. Almost all patterns use inheritance to\nsome extent. So the only patterns labeled \"class patterns\" are those that focus on class\nrelationships. Note that most patterns are in the Object scope. Creational class patterns defer some part of object creation to subclasses, while Cre-\national object patterns defer it to another object. The Structural class patterns use\ninheritance to compose classes, while the Structural object patterns describe ways to\nassemble objects. The Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to describe algorithms\nand flow of control, whereas the Behavioral object patterns describe how a group of\nobjects cooperate to perform a task that no single object can carry out alone. There are other ways to organize the patterns. Some patterns are often used together. For \nexample, Composite is often used with Iterator or Visitor. Some patterns are alternatives:\nPrototype is often an alternative to Abstract Factory. Some patterns result in similar\ndesigns even though the patterns have different intents.

{"text": "Yet another way to organize design patterns is according to how they reference each: other in their \"Related Patterns\" sections. Figure 1.1 \ndepicts these relationships graph-\nically. Clearly there are many ways to organize design patterns. Having multiple ways of\nthinking about patterns will deepen your insight into what they do, how they compare,\nand when to apply them. 1.6 How Design Patterns Solve Design Problems\nDesign patterns solve many of the day-to-day problems object-oriented designers face,\nand in many different ways. Here are several of these problems and how design patterns \nsolve them. Finding Appropriate Objects\nObject-oriented programs are made up of objects. An object packages both data and\nthe procedures that operate on that data. The procedures are typically called methods\nor operations. An object performs an operation when it receives a request (or message)\nfrom a client. Requests are the only way to get an object to execute an operation. Operations are\nthe only way to change an object's internal data. Because of these restrictions, the\nobject's internal state is said to be encapsulated; it cannot be accessed directly, and its\nrepresentation is invisible from outside the object. The hard part about object-oriented design is decomposing a system into objects. The\ntask is difficult because many factors come \ninto play: encapsulation, granularity, depen-\ndency, flexibility, performance, evolution, reusability, and on and on. They all \ninfluence\nthe decomposition, often in conflicting ways. Object-oriented design methodologies favor many different approaches. You \ncan write\na problem statement, single out the nouns and verbs, and create corresponding classes\nand operations. Or you can focus on the collaborations and responsibilities in your\nsystem. Or you can \nmodel the real world and translate the objects found during analysis\ninto design. There will always be disagreement on which approach is best. Many objects in a design come from the analysis model. But object-oriented designs\noften end up with classes that have no counterparts in the real world. Some of these are\nlow-level classes like arrays. Others are much higher-level. For example, the Compos-\nite (163) pattern introduces an abstraction for treating objects uniformly that doesn't\nhave a physical counterpart. Strict modeling of the real world leads to a system that\nreflects today's realities but not necessarily tomorrow's. The abstractions that emerge \nduring design are key to making a design \nflexible.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Software Quality Attributes", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 31", "position": 31, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 386}
{"text": "Design patterns help you identify less-obvious abstractions and the objects that can: capture them. For example, objects that represent a process or algorithm don't occur\nin nature, yet they are a crucial part of flexible designs. The Strategy (315) pattern\ndescribes how to implement interchangeable families of algorithms. The State (305)\npattern represents each state of an entity as an object. These objects are seldom found\nduring analysis or even the early stages of design; they're discovered later in the course\nof making a design more flexible and reusable. Determining Object Granularity\nObjects can vary tremendously in size and number. They can represent everything\ndown to the hardware or all the way up to entire applications. How do we decide what\nshould be an object? Design patterns address this issue as well. The Facade (185) pattern describes how to\nrepresent complete subsystems as objects, and the Flyweight (195) pattern describes\nhow to support huge numbers of objects at the finest granularities. Other design pat-\nterns describe specific ways of decomposing an object into smaller objects.

Specifying Object Interfaces\nEvery operation declared by an object specifies the operation's name, the objects it\ntakes as parameters, and the operation's return value. This is known as the operation's\nsignature. The set of all signatures defined by an object's operations is called the\ninterface to the object. An object's interface characterizes the complete set of requests\nthat can be sent to the object. Any request that matches a signature in the object's\ninterface may be sent to the object. A type is a name used to denote a particular interface. We \nspeak of an object as having\nthe type \"Window\" if it accepts all requests for the operations defined in the interface\nnamed \"Window.\" An object may have many types, and widely different objects can\nshare a type. Part of an object's interface may be characterized by one type, and other\nparts by other types. Two objects of the same type need only share parts of their\ninterfaces. Interfaces can contain other interfaces as subsets. We say that a type is a \nsubtype of another if its interface contains the interface of its supertype.

{"text": "means two objects having completely different implementations can have identical: interfaces. When a request is sent to an object, the particular operation that's performed depends on\nboth the request and the receiving object. Different objects that support identical requests\nmay have different implementations of the operations that fulfill these requests. The\nrun-time association of a request to an object and one of its operations is known as\ndynamic binding. Dynamic binding means that issuing a request doesn't commit you to a particular\nimplementation until run-time. Consequently, you can write programs that expect an\nobject with a particular interface, knowing that any object that has the correct interface\nwill accept the request. Moreover, dynamic binding lets you substitute objects that\nhave identical interfaces for each other at run-time. This substitutability is known as\npolymorphism, and it's a key concept in object-oriented systems. It lets a client object\nmake few assumptions about other objects beyond supporting a particular interface. Polymorphism simplifies the definitions of clients, decouples objects from each other,\nand lets them vary their relationships to each other at run-time. Design patterns help you define interfaces by identifying their key elements and the\nkinds of data that get sent across an interface. A design pattern might also tell you what\nnot to put in the interface. The Memento (283) pattern is a good example. It describes\nhow to encapsulate and save the internal state of an object so that the object can be\nrestored to that state later. The pattern stipulates that Memento objects must define two\ninterfaces: a restricted one that lets clients hold and copy mementos, and a privileged \none that only the original object can use to store and retrieve state in the memento. Design patterns also specify relationships between interfaces. In particular, they often\nrequire some classes to have similar interfaces, \nor they place constraints on the interfaces\nof some classes. For example, both Decorator (175) and Proxy (207) \nrequire the interfaces\nof Decorator and Proxy objects to be identical to the decorated and proxied objects. In\nVisitor (331), the Visitor interface must reflect all classes of objects that visitors can visit.

{"text": "Of course, there's a close relationship between class and type. Because a class defines: the operations an object can perform, it also defines the object's type. When we say\nthat an object is an instance of a class, we imply that the object supports the interface\ndefined by the class. Languages like C++ and Eiffel use classes to specify both an object's type and its imple-\nmentation. Smalltalk programs do not declare the types of variables; consequently, the\ncompiler does not check that the types of objects assigned to a variable are subtypes of\nthe variable's type. Sending a message requires checking that the class of the receiver\nimplements the message, but it doesn't require checking that the receiver is an instance\nof a particular class. It's also important to understand the difference between class inheritance and interface\ninheritance (or subtyping). Class inheritance defines an object's implementation in\nterms of another object's implementation. In short, it's a mechanism for code and\nrepresentation sharing. In contrast, interface inheritance (or subtyping) describes when\nan object can be used in place of another. It's easy to confuse these two concepts, because many languages don't make the dis-\ntinction explicit. In languages like C++ and Eiffel, inheritance means both interface\nand implementation inheritance. The standard way to inherit an interface in C++ is \nto inherit publicly from a class that has (pure) virtual member functions. Pure inter-\nface inheritance can be approximated in C++ by inheriting publicly from pure abstract\nclasses. Pure implementation or class inheritance can be approximated with private\ninheritance. In Smalltalk, inheritance means just implementation inheritance. You \ncan\nassign instances of any class to a variable as long as those instances support the opera-\ntion performed on the value of the variable. Although most programming languages don't support the distinction between inter-\nface and implementation inheritance, people make the distinction in practice. Smalltalk\nprogrammers usually act as if subclasses were subtypes (though there are some well-\nknown exceptions [Coo92]); C++ programmers manipulate objects through types de-\nfined by abstract classes.

{"text": "However, implementation reuse is only half the story. Inheritance's ability to define: families of objects with identical interfaces (usually by inheriting from an abstract \nclass)\nis also important. Why? Because polymorphism depends on it. When inheritance is used carefully (some will say properly), all classes derived from\nan abstract class will share its interface. This implies that a subclass merely adds or\noverrides operations and does not hide operations of the parent class. All subclasses\ncan then respond to the requests in the interface of this abstract class, making them all\nsubtypes of the abstract \nclass. There are two benefits to manipulating objects solely in terms of the interface defined\nby abstract classes:\n1.

{"text": "you define the implementation of one class in terms of another's. Reuse: by subclassing\nis often referred to as white-box reuse. The term \"white-box\" refers to visibility: With\ninheritance, the internals of parent classes are often visible to subclasses. Object composition is an alternative to class inheritance. Here, new functionality is\nobtained by assembling or composing objects to get more complex functionality. Object\ncomposition requires that the objects being composed have well-defined interfaces. This style of reuse is called black-box reuse, because no internal details of objects are\nvisible. Objects appear only as \"black boxes.\" Inheritance and composition each have their advantages and disadvantages. Class\ninheritance is defined statically at compile-time and is straightforward to use, since\nit's supported directly by the programming language. Class inheritance also makes it\neasier to modify the implementation being reused. When a subclass overrides some\nbut not all operations, it can affect the operations it inherits as well, assuming they call\nthe overridden operations. But class inheritance has some disadvantages, too. First, you can't change the imple-\nmentations inherited from parent classes at run-time, because inheritance is defined\nat compile-time. Second, and generally worse, parent classes often define at least part\nof their subclasses' physical representation. Because inheritance exposes a subclass to\ndetails of its parent's implementation, it's often said that \"inheritance breaks encap-\nsulation\" [Sny86]. The implementation of a subclass becomes so bound up with the\nimplementation of its parent class that any change in the parent's implementation will\nforce the subclass to change. Implementation dependencies can cause problems when you're trying to reuse a sub-\nclass. Should any aspect of the inherited implementation not be appropriate for new\nproblem domains, the parent class must be rewritten or replaced by something more \nappropriate. This dependency limits flexibility and ultimately reusability. One cure\nfor this is to inherit only from abstract classes, since they usually provide little or no\nimplementation. Object composition is defined dynamically at run-time through objects acquiring refer-\nences to other objects. Composition requires objects to respect each others' interfaces,\nwhich in turn requires carefully designed interfaces that don't stop you from using\none object with many others. But there is a payoff. Because objects are accessed solely\nthrough their interfaces, we don't break encapsulation. Any object can be replaced at\nrun-time by another as long as it has the same type. Moreover, because an object's im-\nplementation will be written in terms of object interfaces, there are substantially fewer\nimplementation dependencies.", "domains": ["Software Quality Attributes", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 39", "position": 39, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 411}

Our window can become circular\nat run-time simply by replacing its Rectangle \ninstance with a Circle instance, assuming\nRectangle and Circle have the same type. Delegation has a disadvantage it shares with other techniques that make software \nmore\nflexible through object composition: Dynamic, highly parameterized software is harder \nto understand than more static software.

Delegation works best when \nit's used in highly stylized ways\u2014that is, in standard patterns. Several design patterns use delegation. The State (305), \nStrategy (315), and Visitor \n(331)\npatterns depend on it. In the State pattern, an object delegates requests to a State object\nthat represents its current state. In the Strategy pattern, an object delegates a specific\nrequest to an object that represents a strategy for carrying out the request. An object will\nonly have one state, but it can have many strategies for different requests. The purpose\nof both patterns is to change the behavior of an object by changing the objects to which\nit delegates requests. In Visitor, the operation that gets performed on each element of\nan object structure is always delegated to the Visitor object. Other patterns use delegation less heavily. Mediator (273) \nintroduces an object to medi-\nate communication \nbetween other objects. Sometimes the Mediator object implements\noperations simply by forwarding them to the other objects; other times it passes along\na reference to itself and thus uses true delegation. Chain of Responsibility (223) handles\nrequests by forwarding them from one object to another along a chain of objects. Some-\ntimes this request carries with it a reference to the original object receiving the request,\nin which case the pattern is using delegation.

Delegation is an extreme example of object composition. It shows that you can always\nreplace inheritance with object composition as a mechanism for code reuse. Inheritance versus Parameterized Types\nAnother (not strictly object-oriented) technique for reusing functionality is through\nparameterized types, also known as generics (Ada, Eiffel) and templates (C++). This\ntechnique lets you define a type without specifying all the other types it uses. The\nunspecified types are supplied as parameters at the point of use. For example, a List\nclass can be parameterized by the type of elements it contains. To declare a list of\nintegers, you supply the type \"integer\" as a parameter to the List parameterized type.", "domains": ["Design Patterns"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 41", "position": 41, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 155}
{"text": "To declare a list of String objects, you supply the \"String\" type as a parameter. The: language implementation will create a customized version of the List class template for\neach type of element. Parameterized types give us a third way (in addition to class inheritance and object\ncomposition) to compose behavior in object-oriented systems. Many designs can be\nimplemented using any of these three techniques. To \nparameterize a sorting routine by\nthe operation it uses to compare elements, we could make the comparison\n1. an operation implemented by subclasses (an application of Template\nMethod (325)),\n2. the responsibility of an object that's passed to the sorting routine (Strategy (315)),\nor\n3. an argument of a C++ template or Ada generic that specifies the name of the\nfunction to call to compare the elements. There are important differences between these techniques. Object composition lets you\nchange the behavior being composed at run-time, but it also requires indirection and can\nbe less efficient. Inheritance lets you provide default implementations for operations\nand lets subclasses override them. Parameterized types let you change the types that a\nclass can use. But neither inheritance nor parameterized types can change at run-time. Which approach is best depends on your design and implementation constraints. None of the patterns in this book concerns parameterized types, though we use them\non occasion to customize a pattern's C++ implementation. Parameterized types aren't\nneeded at all in a language like Smalltalk that doesn't have compile-time type checking. Relating Run-Time and Compile-Time Structures\nAn object-oriented program's run-time structure often bears little resemblance to its\ncode structure. The code structure is frozen at compile-time; it consists of classes in\nfixed inheritance relationships. A program's run-time structure consists of rapidly\nchanging networks of communicating objects. In fact, the two structures are largely\nindependent. Trying to understand one from the other is like trying to understand the\ndynamism of living ecosystems from the static taxonomy of plants and animals, and\nvice versa. Consider the distinction between object aggregation and acquaintance and how dif-\nferently they manifest themselves at compile- and run-times. Aggregation implies that \none object owns or is responsible for another object. Generally we speak of an object\nhaving or being part of \nanother object. Aggregation implies that an aggregate object and\nits owner have identical lifetimes. Acquaintance implies that an object merely knows of another object. Sometimes ac-\nquaintance is called \"association\" or the \"using\" relationship.

In our diagrams, a plain arrowhead line denotes acquaintance. An arrowhead line with\na diamond at its base denotes aggregation:\nIt's easy to confuse aggregation and acquaintance, because they are often implemented\nin the same way. In Smalltalk, all variables are references to other objects. There's\nno distinction in the programming language between aggregation and acquaintance. In C++, aggregation can be implemented by defining member variables that are real\ninstances, but it's more common to define them as pointers or references to instances. Acquaintance is implemented with pointers and references as well. Ultimately, acquaintance and aggregation are determined more by intent than by ex-\nplicit language mechanisms. The distinction may be hard to see in the compile-time\nstructure, but it's significant. Aggregation relationships tend to be fewer and more\npermanent than acquaintance. Acquaintances, in contrast, are made and remade more\nfrequently, sometimes existing only for the duration of an operation. Acquaintances are\nmore dynamic as well, making them more difficult to discern in the source code. With such disparity between a program's run-time and compile-time structures, it's\nclear that code won't reveal everything about how a system will work. The system's\nrun-time structure must be imposed more by the designer than the language. The \nrelationships between objects and their types must be designed with great care, because\nthey determine how good or bad the run-time structure is. Many design patterns (in particular those that have object scope) capture the distinction\nbetween compile-time and run-time structures explicitly. Composite (163) and Decora-\ntor (175) are especially useful for building complex run-time structures. Observer (293)\ninvolves run-time structures that are often hard to understand unless you know the\npattern. Chain of Responsibility (223) also results in communication patterns that in-\nheritance doesn't reveal. In general, the run-time structures aren't clear from the code\nuntil you understand the patterns. Designing for Change\nThe key to maximizing reuse lies in anticipating new requirements and changes to ex-\nisting requirements, and in designing your systems so that they can evolve accordingly. To design the system so that it's robust to such changes, you must consider how the\nsystem might need to change over its lifetime.

{"text": "redefinition and reimplementation, client modification, and retesting. Redesign affects: many parts of the software system, and unanticipated changes are invariably expensive. Design patterns help you avoid this by ensuring that a system can change in specific\nways. Each design pattern lets some aspect of system structure vary independently of\nother aspects, thereby making a system more robust to a particular kind of change. Here are some common causes of redesign along with the design pattern(s) that address\nthem:\n1. Creating an object by specifying a class explicitly. Specifying a class name when\nyou create an object commits you to a particular implementation instead of a\nparticular interface. This commitment can complicate future changes. To \navoid it,\ncreate objects \nindirectly. Design patterns: Abstract Factory (87), \nFactory Method (107), Prototype (117). 2. Dependence on specific operations. When you specify a particular operation, you\ncommit to one way of satisfying a request. By \navoiding hard-coded requests, you\nmake it easier to change the way a request gets satisfied both at compile-time and\nat run-time. Design patterns: Chain of Responsibility (223), Command (233). 3. Dependence on hardware and software platform. External operating system interfaces\nand application programming interfaces (APIs) are different on different hard-\nware and software platforms. Software that depends on a particular platform will\nbe harder to port to other platforms. It may even be difficult to keep it up to date\non its native platform. It's important therefore to design your system to limit its\nplatform dependencies. Design patterns: Abstract Factory (87), Bridge (151). 4. Dependence on object representations or implementations. Clients that know how an\nobject is represented, stored, located, or implemented might need to be changed\nwhen the object changes. Hiding this information from clients keeps changes\nfrom cascading. Design patterns: Abstract Factory (87), \nBridge (151), Memento (283), \nProxy (207). 5. Algorithmic dependencies. Algorithms are often extended, optimized, and replaced\nduring development and reuse. Objects that depend on an algorithm will have\nto change when the algorithm changes. Therefore algorithms that are likely to\nchange should be isolated. Design patterns: Builder (97), Iterator (257), Strategy (315), Template\nMethod (325), Visitor (331). 6. Tight coupling.

{"text": "other classes. The system becomes a dense mass that's hard to learn, port, and: maintain. Loose coupling increases the probability that a class can be reused by itself and\nthat a system can be learned, ported, modified, and extended more easily. Design\npatterns use techniques such as abstract coupling and layering to promote loosely\ncoupled systems. Design patterns: Abstract \nFactory (87), Bridge (151), \nChain of Responsibility (223),\nCommand (233), Facade (185), Mediator (273), Observer (293). 7. Extending functionality by subclassing. Customizing an object by subclassing often\nisn't easy. Every new class has a fixed implementation overhead (initialization,\nfinalization, etc.). Defining a subclass also requires an in-depth understanding of\nthe parent class. For example, overriding one operation might require overriding\nanother. An overridden operation might be required to call an inherited operation. And subclassing can lead to an explosion of classes, because you might have to\nintroduce many new subclasses for even a simple extension. Object composition in general and delegation in particular provide flexible alter-\nnatives to inheritance for combining behavior. New functionality can be added to\nan application by composing existing objects \nin new ways rather than by defining\nnew subclasses of existing classes. On the other hand, heavy use of object com-\nposition can make designs harder to understand. Many design patterns produce\ndesigns in which you can introduce customized functionality just by defining one\nsubclass and composing its instances with existing ones. Design patterns: Bridge (151), Chain of Responsibility (223), Composite (163),\nDecorator (175), Observer (293), \nStrategy (315). 8. Inability to alter classes conveniently. Sometimes you have to modify a class that\ncan't be modified conveniently. Perhaps you need the source code and don't have\nit (as may be the case with a commercial class library). Or maybe any change\nwould require modifying lots of existing subclasses. Design patterns offer ways\nto modify classes in such circumstances. Design patterns: Adapter (139), Decorator (175), Visitor \n(331). These examples reflect the flexibility that design patterns can help you build into\nyour software. How crucial such flexibility is depends on the kind of software you're\nbuilding. Let's look at the role design patterns play in the development of three broad\nclasses of software: application programs, toolkits, and frameworks. Application Programs\nIf you're building an application program such as a document editor or spreadsheet,\nthen internal reuse, maintainability, and extension are high priorities. Internal reuse\nensures that you don't design and implement any more than you have to.

{"text": "patterns that reduce dependencies can increase internal reuse. Looser coupling boosts: the likelihood that one class of object can cooperate with several others. For example,\nwhen you eliminate dependencies on specific operations by isolating and encapsulating\neach operation, you make it easier to reuse an operation in different contexts. The same\nthing can happen when you remove algorithmic and representational dependencies\ntoo. Design patterns also make an application more maintainable \nwhen they're used to limit\nplatform dependencies and to layer a system. They enhance extensibility by showing\nyou how to extend class hierarchies and how to exploit object composition. Reduced\ncoupling also enhances extensibility. Extending a class in isolation is easier if the class \ndoesn't depend on lots of other classes. Toolkits\nOften an application will incorporate classes from one or more libraries of predefined\nclasses called toolkits. A toolkit is a set of related and reusable classes designed to pro-\nvide useful, general-purpose functionality. An example of a toolkit is a set of collection\nclasses for lists, associative tables, stacks, and the like. The C++ I/O stream library is\nanother example. Toolkits don't impose a particular design on your application; they\njust provide functionality that can help your application do its job. They let you as\nan implementer avoid receding common functionality. Toolkits emphasize code reuse. They are the object-oriented equivalent of subroutine libraries. Toolkit design is arguably harder than application design, because toolkits have to\nwork in many applications to be useful. Moreover, the toolkit writer isn't in a position\nto know what those applications will be or their special needs. That makes it all the\nmore important to avoid assumptions and dependencies that can limit the toolkit's\nflexibility and consequently its applicability and effectiveness. Frameworks\nA framework is a set of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design for a specific\nclass of software [Deu89, JF88]. For example, a framework can be geared toward build-\ning graphical editors for different domains like artistic drawing, music composition,\nand mechanical CAD [VL90, Joh92]. Another framework can help you build compilers\nfor different programming languages and target machines [JML92]. Yet \nanother might\nhelp you build financial modeling applications [BE93].

Design patterns are smaller architectural elements than frameworks. A typical frame-\nwork contains several design patterns, but the reverse is never true. 3.

Choose names for pattern participants that are meaningful in the application context. The names for participants in design patterns are usually too abstract to appear\ndirectly in an application. Nevertheless, it's useful to incorporate the participant \nname into the name that appears in the application. That helps make the pattern\nmore explicit in the implementation. For example, if you use the Strategy pattern\nfor a text compositing algorithm, then you might have classes \nSimpleLayoutStrat-\negy or TeXLayoutStrategy. 5. Define the classes.

All editing, formatting, displaying, and\ntextual analysis will require traversing the representation. The way we organize\nthis information will impact the design of the rest of the application. 2.

Lexi should adapt easily to different\nlook-and-feel standards such as Motif and Presentation Manager (PM) without\nmajor modification. 5. Supporting multiple window systems. Different look-and-feel standards are usually\nimplemented on different window systems. Lexi's design should be as indepen-\ndent of the window system as possible. 6. User operations. Users control Lexi through various user interfaces, including but-\ntons and pull-down menus. The functionality behind these interfaces is scattered\nthroughout the objects in the application. The challenge here is to provide a uni-\nform mechanism both for accessing this scattered functionality and for undoing\nits effects. 7. Spelling checking and hyphenation. How does Lexi support analytical operations\nsuch as checking for misspelled words and determining hyphenation points? How can we minimize the number of classes we have to modify to add a new\nanalytical operation? We discuss these design problems in the sections that follow.

This\nlets Lexi determine what the user is referring to when he points to something in\nthe visual representation. In addition to these goals are some constraints. First, we should treat text and graphics\nuniformly. The application's interface lets the user embed text within graphics freely\nand vice versa. We should avoid treating graphics as a special case of text or text\nas a special case of graphics; otherwise we'll end up with redundant formatting and\nmanipulation mechanisms. One set of mechanisms should suffice for both text and\ngraphics. Second, our implementation shouldn't have to distinguish between single elements and\ngroups of elements in the internal representation. Lexi should be able to treat simple\nand complex elements uniformly, thereby allowing arbitrarily complex documents. The \ntenth element in line five of column two, for instance, could be a single character or an\nintricate diagram with many subelements. As long as we know this element can draw\nitself and specify its dimensions, its complexity has no bearing on how and where it\nshould appear on the page. Opposing the second constraint, however, is the need to analyze the text for such things\nas spelling errors and potential hyphenation points. Often we don't care whether the\nelement of a line is a simple or complex object. But sometimes an analysis depends on\nthe objects being analyzed. It makes little sense, for example, to check the spelling of a\npolygon or to hyphenate it. The internal representation's design should take this and\nother potentially conflicting constraints into \naccount.

The Bounds operation returns the rectangular area that the glyph occupies. It returns the opposite corners of the smallest rectangle that contains the glyph.

Next, we need\nto figure out how to construct a particular physical structure, one that corresponds to a\nproperly formatted document. Representation and formatting are distinct: The ability\nto capture the document's physical structure doesn't tell us how to arrive at a particular\nstructure.

There are many approaches to the problem, and people have come up with a variety\nof formatting algorithms with different strengths and weaknesses. Because Lexi is a\nWYSIWYG editor, an important trade-off to consider is the balance between formatting\nquality and formatting speed. We want generally good response from the editor with-\nout sacrificing how good the document looks. This trade-off is subject to many factors,\nnot all of which can be ascertained at compile-time.

We could add a border to Composition by subclassing it to yield a BorderedComposi-\ntion class. Or we could add a scrolling interface in the same way to yield a Scrollable-\nComposition. If we want both scroll bars and a border, we might produce a Bordered-\nScrollableComposition, and so forth. In the extreme, we end up with a class for every\npossible combination of embellishments, a solution that quickly becomes unworkable\nas the variety of embellishments grows. Object composition offers a potentially more workable and flexible extension mecha-\nnism. But what objects do we compose? Since we know we're embellishing an existing\nglyph, we could make the embellishment itself an object (say, an instance of class Bor-\nder). That gives us two candidates for composition, the glyph and the border. The next\nstep is to decide who composes whom. We could have the border contain the glyph,\nwhich makes sense given that the border will surround the glyph on the screen. Or\nwe could do the opposite\u2014put the border into the glyph\u2014but then we must make\nmodifications to the corresponding Glyph subclass to make it aware of the border. Our\nfirst choice, composing the glyph in the border, keeps the border-drawing code entirely\nin the Border class, leaving other classes alone. What does the Border class look like? The fact that borders have an appearance suggests\nthey should actually be glyphs; that is, Border should be a subclass of Glyph. But\nthere's a more compelling reason for doing this: Clients shouldn't care whether glyphs\nhave borders or not. They should treat glyphs uniformly. When clients tell a plain, \nunbordered glyph to draw itself, it should do so without embellishment. If that glyph\nis composed in a border, clients shouldn't have to treat the border containing the glyph\nany differently; they just tell it to draw itself as they told the plain glyph before. This\nimplies that the Border interface matches the Glyph interface. We subclass Border from\nGlyph to guarantee this relationship. All this leads us to the concept of transparent enclosure, which combines the notions\nof (1) single-child (or single-component) composition and (2) compatible interfaces.

The point is, transparent enclosure makes it easy to\nexperiment with different alternatives, and it keeps clients free of embellishment code.

But suppose we initialize sb as follows:\nScrollBar* sb = guiFactory->CreateScrollBar();\nwhere guiFactory is an instance of a MotifFactory class. CreateScrollBar returns\na new instance of the proper ScrollBar subclass for the look and feel desired, Motif in this\ncase. As far as clients are concerned, the effect is the same as calling the MotifScrollBar \nconstructor directly.

It can manufacture a full range of\nwidget glyphs, including scroll bars, buttons, entry fields, menus, and so forth. All this is possible because MotifFactory is a subclass of GUIFactory, an abstract class\nthat defines a general interface for creating widget glyphs. It includes operations like\nCreateScrollBar and CreateButton for instantiating different kinds of widget\nglyphs. Subclasses of GUIFactory \nimplement these operations to return glyphs such\nas MotifScrollBar and PMButton that implement a particular look and feel.

And you don't have to link all platform-specific factories into the\napplication. That's important, because it might not be possible to link a MotifFactory\non a platform that doesn't support Motif. But the point is that once we've configured the application with the right factory\nobject, its look and feel is set from then on. If we change our minds, we can reinitialize\nguiFactory with a factory for a different look and feel and then reconstruct the\ninterface. Regardless of how and when we decide to initialize guiFactory, we know\nthat once we do, the application can create the appropriate look and feel without\nmodification. Abstract Factory Pattern\nFactories and products are the key participants in the Abstract Factory (87) \npattern. This\npattern captures how to create families of related product objects \nwithout instantiating\nclasses directly. It's most appropriate when the number and general kinds of product\nobjects stay constant, and there are differences in specific product families. We choose\nbetween families by instantiating a particular concrete factory and using it consistently\nto create products thereafter. We can also swap entire families of products by replacing\nthe concrete factory with an instance of a different one. The Abstract Factory pattern's\nemphasis on families of products distinguishes it from other creational patterns, which\ninvolve only one kind of product object. 2.6 Supporting Multiple Window Systems\nLook and feel is just one of many portability issues.

We'd like Lexi to run on as many of them as possible for \nexactly\nthe same reasons we support multiple look-and-feel standards. Can We Use an Abstract Factory? At first glance this may look like another opportunity to apply the Abstract Factory\npattern. But the constraints for window system portability differ significantly from\nthose for look-and-feel independence. In applying the Abstract Factory pattern, we assumed we would define the concrete\nwidget glyph classes for each look-and-feel \nstandard. That meant we could derive each\nconcrete product for a particular standard (e.g., MotifScrollBar and MacScrollBar) from\nan abstract product class (e.g., ScrollBar). But suppose we already have several class\nhierarchies from different vendors, one for each look-and-feel standard. Of course, it's\nhighly unlikely these hierarchies are compatible in any way. Hence we won't have a\ncommon abstract \nproduct class for each kind of widget (ScrollBar, Button, \nMenu, etc. )\u2014\nand the Abstract Factory pattern won't work without those crucial classes. We have\nto make the different widget hierarchies adhere to a common set of abstract product\ninterfaces. Only then could we declare the Create. . . operations properly in our\nabstract factory's interface. We solved this problem for widgets by developing our own abstract and concrete prod-\nuct classes. Now we're faced with a similar problem when we try to make Lexi work\non existing window systems; namely, different window systems have incompatible\nprogramming interfaces. Things are a bit tougher this time, though, because we can't\nafford to implement our own nonstandard window system. But there's a saving grace. Like look-and-feel standards, window system interfaces\naren't radically different from one another, because all window systems do generally\nthe same thing. We need a uniform set of windowing abstractions that lets us take\ndifferent window system implementations and slide any one of them under a common\ninterface. Encapsulating Implementation Dependencies\nIn Section 2.2 we introduced a Window class for displaying a glyph or glyph structure\non the display. We didn't specify the window system that this object worked with,\nbecause the truth is that it doesn't come from any particular window system.

The Window class must span the functionality of windows from different window\nsystems. Let's consider two extreme philosophies:\n1. Intersection of functionality. The Window class interface provides only functionality\nthat's common to all window systems. The problem with this approach is that our\nWindow interface winds up being only as powerful as the least capable window \nsystem. We can't take advantage of more advanced features even if most (but not\nall) window systems support them. 2. Union of functionality. Create an interface that incorporates the capabilities of all\nexisting systems. The trouble here is that the resulting interface may well be huge\nand incoherent. Besides, we'll have to change it (and Lexi, which depends on it)\nanytime a vendor revises its window system interface. Neither extreme is a viable solution, so our design will fall somewhere between the\ntwo. The Window class will provide a convenient interface that supports the most\npopular windowing features. Because \nLexi \nwill deal with this class directly, the Window\nclass must also support the things Lexi knows about, namely, glyphs. That means\nWindow's interface must include a basic set of graphics operations that lets glyphs\ndraw themselves in the window. Table 2.3 gives a sampling of the operations in the\nWindow class interface. Window is an abstract class. Concrete subclasses of Window support the different kinds\nof windows that users deal with.

The windowSystemFactory variable can be initialized in the same way. Bridge Pattern\nThe Windowlmp class defines an interface to common window system facilities, but\nits design is driven by different constraints than Window's interface. Application pro-\ngrammers won't deal with Windowimp's interface directly; they only deal with Win-\ndow objects. So Windowlmp's interface needn't match the application programmer's\nview of the world, as was our concern in the design of the Window class hierarchy\nand interface. Windowlmp's interface can more closely reflect what window systems\nactually provide, warts and all. It can be biased toward either an intersection or a union\nof functionality approach, whichever suits the target window systems best. The important thing to realize is that Window's interface caters to the applications\nprogrammer, while Windowlmp caters to window systems. Separating windowing\nfunctionality into Window and Windowlmp hierarchies lets us implement and special-\nize these interfaces independently. Objects from these hierarchies cooperate to let Lexi \nwork without modification on multiple window systems. The relationship between Window and Windowlmp is an example of the Bridge (151)\npattern. The intent behind Bridge is to allow separate class hierarchies to work together\neven as they evolve independently. Our design criteria led us to create two separate\nclass hierarchies, one that supports the logical notion of windows, and another for\ncapturing different implementations of windows. The Bridge pattern lets us maintain\nand enhance our logical windowing abstractions without touching window system-\ndependent code, and vice versa. 2.7 User Operations\nSome of Lexi's functionality is available through the document's WYSIWYG represen-\ntation.

Other functionality is accessed \nindirectly through user operations in Lexi's pull-down menus, buttons, and keyboard\naccelerators. The functionality includes operations for\n\u2022 creating a new document,\n\u2022 opening, saving, and printing an existing document,", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Domain-Driven Design", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 78", "position": 78, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 347}

Lexi provides different user interfaces for these operations. But we don't want to\nassociate a particular user operation with a particular user interface, because we may\nwant multiple user interfaces to the same operation (you can turn the page using either\na page button or a menu operation, for example). We may also want to change the\ninterface in the future. Furthermore, these operations are implemented in many different classes. We \nas imple-\nmentors want to access their functionality without creating a lot of dependencies be-\ntween implementation and user interface classes. Otherwise we'll end up with a tightly\ncoupled implementation, which will be harder to understand, extend, and maintain. To further complicate matters, we want Lexi to support undo and redo8 of most but\nnot all its functionality. Specifically, we want to be able to undo document-modifying\noperations like delete, with which a user can destroy lots of data inadvertently. But we\nshouldn't try to undo an operation like saving a drawing or quitting the application. These operations should have no effect on the undo process. We also don't want an\narbitrary limit on the number of levels of undo and redo. It's clear that support for user operations permeates the application. The challenge is\nto come up with a simple and extensible mechanism that satisfies all of these needs. Encapsulating a Request\nFrom our perspective as designers, a pull-down menu is just another kind of glyph that\ncontains other glyphs. What distinguishes pull-down menus from other glyphs that\nhave children is that most glyphs in menus do some work in response to an up-click. Let's assume that these work-performing glyphs are instances of a Glyph subclass\ncalled Menultem and that they do their work in response to a request from a client.9\nCarrying out the request might involve an operation on one object, or many operations\non many objects, or something in between. We could define a subclass of Menultem for every user operation and then hard-code\neach subclass to carry out the request.", "domains": ["Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 79", "position": 79, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 379}
{"text": "string in a pull-down menu. Moreover, this approach couples the request to a particular: user interface, making it hard to fulfill the request through a different user interface. To illustrate, suppose you could advance to the last page in the document both through\na Menultem in a pull-down menu and by pressing a page icon at the bottom of Lexi's\ninterface (which might be more convenient for short documents). If we associate the\nrequest with a Menultem through inheritance, then we must do the same for the page\nicon and any other kind of widget that might issue such a request. That can give rise\nto a number of classes approaching the product of the number of widget types and the\nnumber of requests. What's missing is a mechanism that lets us parameterize menu items by the request\nthey should fulfill. That way we avoid a proliferation of subclasses and allow for greater\nflexibility at run-time. We could parameterize Menultem with a function to call, but\nthat's not a complete solution for at least three reasons:\n1. It doesn't address the undo/redo problem. 2. It's hard to associate state with a function. For example, a function that changes\nthe font needs to know which font. 3. Functions are hard to extend, and it's hard to reuse parts of them. These reasons suggest that we should parameterize Menultems with an object, not a\nfunction. Then we can use inheritance to extend and reuse the request's implementation. We also have a place to store state and implement undo/redo functionality. Here we \nhave another example of encapsulating the concept that varies, in this case a request. We'll encapsulate each request in a command object. Command Class and Subclasses\nFirst we define a Command abstract class to provide an interface for issuing a request. The basic interface consists of a single abstract operation called \"Execute.\" Subclasses\nof Command implement Execute in different ways to fulfill different requests. Some\nsubclasses may delegate part or all of the work to other objects. Other subclasses may be\nin a position to fulfill the request entirely on their own (see Figure 2.11). To \nthe requester,\nhowever, a Command object is a Command object\u2014they are treated uniformly. Now Menultem can store a Command object that encapsulates a request (Figure 2.12).

Unexecute re-\nverses the effects of a preceding Execute operation using whatever undo information\nExecute stored. In the case of a FontCommand, for example, the Execute operation\nwould store the range of text affected by the font change along with the original font(s). FontCommand's Unexecute operation would restore the range of text to its original\nfont(s). Sometimes undoability must be determined at run-time. A request to change the font\nof a selection does nothing if the text already appears in that font. Suppose the user\nselects some text and then requests a spurious font change.

The Command pattern prescribes a uniform interface\nfor issuing requests that lets you configure clients to handle different requests. The\ninterface shields clients from the request's implementation. A command may delegate \nall, part, or none of the request's implementation to other objects.

As was the case for linebreaking strategies, there's more than one way to\ncheck spelling and compute hyphenation points. So \nhere too we want to support multi-\nple algorithms. A diverse set of algorithms can provide a choice of space/time/quality\ntrade-offs. We should make it easy to add new algorithms as well. We also want to avoid wiring this functionality into the document structure. This goal is\neven more important here than it was in the formatting case, because spelling checking\nand hyphenation are just two of potentially many kinds of analyses we may want\nLexi to support. Inevitably we'll want to expand Lexi's analytical abilities over time. We might add searching, word counting, a calculation facility for adding up tabular\nvalues, grammar checking, and so forth.

{"text": "There are actually two pieces to this puzzle: (1) accessing the information to be analyzed,: which we have scattered over the glyphs in the document structure, and (2) doing the\nanalysis. We'll look at these two pieces separately. Accessing Scattered Information\nMany kinds of analysis require examining the text character by character. The text we\nneed to analyze is scattered throughout a hierarchical structure of glyph objects. To\nexamine text in such a structure, we need an access mechanism that has knowledge\nabout the data structures in which objects are stored. Some glyphs might store their\nchildren in linked lists, others might use arrays, and still others might use more esoteric\ndata structures. Our access mechanism must be able to handle all of these possibilities. An added complication is that different analyses access information in different ways. Most analyses will traverse the text from beginning to end. But some do the opposite\u2014a\nreverse search, for example, needs to progress through the text backward rather than\nforward. Evaluating algebraic expressions could require an inorder traversal. So our access mechanism must accommodate differing data structures, and we must\nsupport different kinds of traversals, such as preorder, postorder, and inorder. Encapsulating Access and Traversal\nRight now our glyph interface uses an integer index to let clients refer to children. Although that might be reasonable for glyph classes that store their children in an\narray, it may be inefficient for glyphs that use a linked list. An important role of the \nglyph abstraction is to hide the data structure in which children are stored. That way\nwe can change the data structure a glyph class uses without affecting other classes. Therefore only the glyph can know the data structure it uses. A corollary is that the\nglyph interface shouldn't be biased toward one data structure or another. It shouldn't\nbe better suited to arrays than to linked lists, for example, as it is now. We can solve this problem and support several different kinds of traversals at the\nsame time. We can put multiple access and traversal capabilities directly in the glyph\nclasses and provide a way to choose among them, perhaps by supplying an enumerated\nconstant as a parameter. The classes pass this parameter around during a traversal to\nensure they're all doing the same kind of traversal. They have to pass around any\ninformation they've accumulated during traversal.

Even so, the problem of\niteration has surprising depth, and the Iterator pattern covers many more nuances and\ntrade-offs than we've considered here. Traversal versus Traversal Actions\nNow that we have a way of traversing the glyph structure, we need to check the spelling\nand do the hyphenation. Both analyses involve accumulating information during the\ntraversal. First we have to decide where to put the responsibility for analysis. We could put it in the\nIterator classes, thereby making analysis an integral part of traversal. But we get more\nflexibility and potential for reuse if we distinguish between the traversal and the actions\nperformed during traversal. That's because different analyses often require the same\nkind of traversal. Hence we can reuse the same set of iterators for different analyses. For\nexample, preorder traversal is common to many analyses, including spelling checking,\nhyphenation, forward search, and word count. So analysis and traversal should be separate. Where else can we put the responsibility\nfor analysis? We know there are many kinds of analyses we might want to do. Each\nanalysis will do different things at different points in the traversal. Some glyphs are\nmore significant than others depending on the kind of analysis. If we're checking\nspelling or hyphenating, we want to consider character glyphs and not graphical ones\nlike lines and bitmapped images.

Therefore a given analysis must be able to distinguish different kinds of glyphs. An\nobvious approach is to put the analytical capability into the glyph classes themselves. For each analysis we can add one or more abstract operations to the Glyph class and\nhave subclasses implement them in accordance with the role they play in the analysis. But the trouble with that approach is that we'll have to change every glyph class\nwhenever we add a new kind of analysis.

{"text": "Chapter 3: Creational Patterns\nCreational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system\nindependent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. A class cre-\national pattern uses inheritance to vary the class that's instantiated, whereas an object\ncreational pattern will delegate instantiation to another object. Creational patterns become important as systems evolve to depend more on object\ncomposition than class inheritance. As that happens, emphasis shifts away from hard-\ncoding a fixed set of behaviors toward defining a smaller set of fundamental behaviors\nthat can be composed into any number of more complex ones. Thus creating objects\nwith particular behaviors requires more than simply instantiating a class. There are two recurring themes in these patterns. First, they all encapsulate knowledge\nabout which concrete classes the system uses. Second, they hide how instances of these\nclasses are created and put together. All the system at large knows about the objects is\ntheir interfaces as defined by abstract classes. Consequently, the creational patterns give\nyou a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, how it gets created, and when. They let you configure a system with \"product\" objects that vary widely in structure\nand functionality. Configuration can be static (that is, specified at compile-time) or\ndynamic (at run-time). Sometimes creational patterns are competitors. For example, there are cases when either\nPrototype (117) or Abstract Factory (87) could be used profitably.

Different look-and-feels define different\nappearances and behaviors for user interface \"widgets\" like scroll bars, windows,\nand buttons. To be portable across look-and-feel standards, an application should\nnot hard-code its widgets for a particular look and feel. Instantiating look-and-\nf \neel-specific classes of widgets throughout the application makes it hard to change\nthe look and feel later. We can solve this problem by defining an abstract WidgetFactory class that de-\nclares an interface for creating each basic kind of widget. There's also an abstract \nclass for each kind of widget, and concrete subclasses implement widgets for\nspecific look-and-feel \nstandards. WidgetFactory's interface has an operation that \nreturns a new widget object for each abstract widget class.

The Abstract Factory pattern helps you control the\nclasses of objects that an application creates. Because a factory encapsulates\nthe responsibility and the process of creating product objects, \nit isolates clients\nfrom implementation classes. Clients manipulate instances through their\nabstract interfaces. Product class names are isolated in the implementation\nof the concrete factory; they do not appear in client code. 2. It makes exchanging product families easy. The class of a concrete factory appears\nonly once in an application\u2014that is, where it's instantiated. This makes it\neasy to change the concrete factory an application uses. It can use different\nproduct configurations simply by changing the concrete factory.

{"text": "3. It promotes consistency among products. When product objects in a family are: designed to work together, it's important that an application use objects from\nonly one family at a time. AbstractFactory makes this easy to enforce. 4. Supporting new kinds of products is difficult. Extending abstract factories to\nproduce new kinds of Products isn't easy. That's because the AbstractFactory\ninterface fixes the set of products that can be created. Supporting new kinds \nof\nproducts requires extending the factory interface, which involves changing\nthe AbstractFactory class and all of its subclasses. We \ndiscuss one solution to\nthis problem in the Implementation section. Implementation\nHere are some useful techniques for implementing the Abstract Factory pattern. 1. Factories as singletons. An application typically needs only one instance of a\nConcreteFactory per product family. So it's usually best implemented as a\nSingleton (127). 2. Creating the products. AbstractFactory only declares an interface for creating\nproducts. It's up to ConcreteProduct subclasses to actually create them. The\nmost common way to do this is to define a factory method (see Factory\nMethod (107)) for each product. A concrete factory will specify its products\nby overriding the factory method for each. While this implementation is\nsimple, it requires a new concrete factory subclass for each product family, \neven if the product families differ only slightly. If many product families are possible, the concrete factory can be imple-\nmented using the Prototype (117) pattern. The concrete factory is initialized\nwith a prototypical instance of each product in the family, and it creates a new\nproduct by cloning its prototype. The Prototype-based approach eliminates\nthe need for a new concrete factory class for each new product family. Here's a way to implement a Prototype-based factory in Smalltalk. The\nconcrete factory stores the prototypes to be cloned in a dictionary called\npartCatalog. The method make: retrieves the prototype and clones it:\nmake: partName\n(partCatalog at: partName) copy\nThe concrete factory has a method for adding parts to the catalog. addPart: partTemplate named: partName\npartCatalog at: partName put: partTemplate\nPrototypes are added to the factory by identifying them with a symbol:\naFactory addPart: aPrototype named: #ACMEWidget\nA variation on the Prototype-based approach is possible in languages that\ntreat classes as first-class objects (Smalltalk \nand Objective \nC, for example).

{"text": "ABSTRACT FACTORY: 91\ncan think of a class in these languages as a degenerate factory that creates\nonly one kind of product. You can store classes inside a concrete factory\nthat create the various concrete products in variables, much like prototypes. These classes create new instances on behalf of the concrete factory. You\ndefine a new factory by initializing an instance of a concrete factory with\nclasses of products rather than by subclassing. This approach takes advantage\nof language characteristics, whereas the pure Prototype-based approach is\nlanguage-independent. Like the Prototype-based factory in Smalltalk just discussed, the class-based\nversion will have a single instance variable partCatalog, which is a dictio-\nnary whose key is the name of the part. Instead of storing prototypes to be\ncloned, partCatalog stores the classes of the products. The method make:\nnow looks like this:\nmake: partName \n(partCatalog at: partName) new\n3. Defining extensible factories. AbstractFactory usually defines a different op-\neration for each kind of product it can produce. The kinds of products are\nencoded in the operation signatures. Adding a new kind of product requires\nchanging the AbstractFactory interface and all the classes that depend on it. A more flexible but less safe design is to add a parameter to operations that\ncreate objects. This parameter specifies the kind of object to be created. It\ncould be a class identifier, an integer, a string, or anything else that identifies\nthe kind of product. In fact with this approach, AbstractFactory only needs\na single \"Make\" operation with a parameter indicating the kind of object\nto create. This is the technique used in the Prototype- and the class-based\nabstract factories discussed earlier. This variation is easier to use in a dynamically typed language like Smalltalk\nthan in a statically typed language like C++. You \ncan use it in C++ only when\nall objects have the same abstract base class or when the product objects can\nbe safely coerced to the correct type by the client that requested them. The\nimplementation section of Factory Method (107) shows how to implement\nsuch parameterized operations in \nC++.

This is another common implementation for simple applica-\ntions of the Abstract \nFactory \npattern. Because the MazeFactory is a concrete class\nconsisting entirely of factory methods, it's easy to make a new MazeFactory by\nmaking a subclass and overriding the operations that need to change. CreateMaze used the SetSide operation on rooms to specify their sides. If it\ncreates rooms with a BombedMazeFactory, then the maze will be made up of\nRoomWithABomb objects with BombedWall sides. If RoomWithABomb had to\naccess a subclass-specific member of BombedWall, then it would have to cast a\nreference to its walls from Wall* to BombedWall*. This downcasting is safe as\nlong as the argument is in fact a BombedWall, which is guaranteed to be true if\nwalls are built solely with a BombedMazeFactory.

{"text": "Consequences: Here are key consequences of the Builder pattern:\n1. It lets you vary a product's internal representation. The Builder object provides\nthe director with an abstract interface for constructing the product. The in-\nterface lets the builder hide the representation and internal structure of the\nproduct. It also hides how the product gets assembled. Because the product\nis constructed through an abstract interface, all you have to do to change the\nproduct's internal representation is define a new kind of builder. 2. It isolates code for construction and representation. The Builder pattern improves\nmodularity by encapsulating the way a complex object is constructed and\nrepresented. Clients needn't know anything about the classes that define the\nproduct's internal structure; such classes don't appear in Builder's interface. Each ConcreteBuilder contains all the code to create and assemble a partic-\nular kind of product. The code is written once; then different Directors can\nreuse it to build Product variants from the same set of parts. In the earlier\nRTF example, we could define a reader for a format other than RTF, say,\nan SGMLReader, and use the same TextConverters to generate ASCIIText,\nTeXText, and TextWidget renditions of SGML documents. 3. It gives you finer control over the construction process. Unlike creational pat-\nterns that construct products in one shot, the Builder pattern constructs the\nproduct step by step under the director's control. Only when the product\nis finished does the director retrieve it from the builder. Hence the Builder\ninterface reflects the process of constructing the product more than other cre-\national patterns. This gives you finer control over the construction process\nand consequently the internal structure of the resulting product. Implementation\nTypically there's an abstract Builder class that defines an operation for each com-\nponent that a director may ask it to create. The operations do nothing by default. A ConcreteBuilder class overrides operations for components it's interested in\ncreating. Here are other implementation issues to consider:\n1. Assembly and construction interface. Builders construct their products in step-\nby-step fashion. Therefore the Builder class interface must be general enough\nto allow the construction of products for all kinds of concrete builders.

In that case,\nthe builder would return child nodes to the director, which then would pass\nthem back to the builder to build the parent nodes. 2. Why no abstract class \nfor products? In the common case, the products produced\nby the concrete builders differ so greatly in their representation that there\nis little to gain from giving different products a common parent class. In\nthe RTF example, the ASCIIText and the TextWidget objects are unlikely to\nhave a common interface, nor do they need one.

Its text building block\nuses a builder to process text stored in the RTF format. Builder is a common pattern in Smalltalk-80 [Par90]:\n\u2022 The Parser class in the compiler subsystem is a Director that takes a Pro-\ngramNodeBuilder object as an argument. A Parser object notifies its Pro-\ngramNodeBuilder object each time it recognizes a syntactic construct. When\nthe parser is done, it asks the builder for the parse tree it built and returns it\nto the client. \u2022 ClassBuilder is a builder that Classes use to create subclasses for themselves. In this case a Class is both the Director and the Product. \u2022 ByteCodeStream is a builder that creates a compiled method as a byte ar-\nray. ByteCodeStream is a nonstandard use of the Builder pattern, because \nthe complex object it builds is encoded as a byte array, not as a normal\nSmalltalk object. But the interface to ByteCodeStream is typical of a builder,\nand it would be easy to replace ByteCodeStream with a different class that\nrepresented programs as a composite object. The Service Configurator framework from the Adaptive Communications Envi-\nronment uses a builder to construct network service components that are linked\ninto a server at run-time [SS94]. The components are described with a config-\nuration language that's parsed by an LALR(l) parser. The semantic actions of\nthe parser perform operations on the builder that add information to the service\ncomponent. In this case, the parser is the Director. Related Patterns\nAbstract Factory (87) is similar to Builder in that it too may construct complex\nobjects. The primary difference is that the Builder pattern focuses on constructing a\ncomplex object step by step. Abstract Factory's emphasis is on families of product\nobjects (either simple or complex).

{"text": "FACTORY METHOD: 109\n\u2022 ConcreteCreator (MyApplication)\n- overrides the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct. Collaborations\n\u2022 Creator relies on its subclasses to define the factory method so that it returns\nan instance of the appropriate ConcreteProduct. Consequences\nFactory methods eliminate the need to bind application-specific classes into your\ncode. The code only deals with the Product interface; therefore it can work with\nany user-defined ConcreteProduct classes. A potential disadvantage of factory methods is that clients might have to subclass\nthe Creator class just to create a particular ConcreteProduct object. Subclassing is\nfine when the client has to subclass the Creator class anyway, but otherwise the\nclient now must deal with another point of evolution. Here are two additional consequences of the Factory Method pattern:\n1. Provides hooks for subclasses. Creating objects inside a class with a factory\nmethod is always more flexible than creating an object directly. Factory\nMethod gives subclasses a hook for providing an extended version of an \nobject. In the Document example, the Document class could define a factory method\ncalled CreateFileDialog that creates a default file dialog object for opening an\nexisting document. A Document subclass can define an application-specific\nfile dialog by overriding this factory method. In this case the factory method\nis not abstract but provides a reasonable default implementation. 2. Connects parallel class hierarchies. In the examples we've considered so far, the\nfactory method is only called by Creators. But this doesn't have to be the\ncase; clients can find factory methods useful, especially in the case of parallel\nclass hierarchies. Parallel class hierarchies result when a class delegates some of its responsibil-\nities to a separate class. Consider graphical figures that can be manipulated\ninteractively; that is, they can be stretched, moved, or rotated using the\nmouse. Implementing such interactions isn't always easy. It often requires\nstoring and updating information that records the state of the manipulation\nat a given time. This state is needed only during manipulation; therefore\nit needn't be kept in the figure object. Moreover, different figures behave\ndifferently when the user manipulates them. For example, stretching a line\nfigure might have the effect of moving an endpoint, whereas stretching a text\nfigure may change its line spacing. With these constraints, it's better to use a separate Manipulator object that\nimplements the interaction and keeps track \nof any manipulation-specific \nstate", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Domain-Driven Design", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 129", "position": 129, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 395}
{"text": "that's needed. Different figures will use different Manipulator subclasses to: handle particular interactions. The resulting Manipulator class hierarchy\nparallels (at least partially) the Figure class hierarchy:\nThe Figure class provides a CreateManipulator factory method that lets\nclients create a Figure's corresponding Manipulator. Figure subclasses over-\nride this method to return an instance of the Manipulator subclass that's right\nfor them. Alternatively, the Figure class may implement CreateManipulator \nto return a default Manipulator instance, and Figure subclasses may simply\ninherit that default. The Figure classes that do so need no corresponding\nManipulator subclass\u2014hence the hierarchies are only partially parallel. Notice how the factory method defines the connection between the two class\nhierarchies. It localizes knowledge of which classes belong together. Implementation\nConsider the following issues when applying the Factory Method pattern:\n1. Two major varieties. The two main variations of the Factory \nMethod pattern are\n(1) the case when the Creator class is an abstract class and does not provide\nan implementation for the factory method it declares, and (2) \nthe case when\nthe Creator is a concrete class and provides a default implementation for\nthe factory method. It's also possible to have an abstract class that defines a\ndefault implementation, but this is less common. The first case requires subclasses to define an implementation,because there's\nno reasonable default. It gets around the dilemma of having to instantiate\nunforeseeable classes. In the second case, the concrete Creator uses the fac-\ntory method primarily for flexibility. It's following a rule that says, \"Create\nobjects in a separate operation so that subclasses can override the way they're\ncreated.\" This rule ensures that designers of subclasses can change the class\nof objects their parent class instantiates if necessary. 2. Parameterized factory methods. Another variation on the pattern lets the fac-\ntory method create multiple kinds of products.

In the Document example,\nApplication might support different kinds of Documents. You pass Create-\nDocument an extra parameter to specify the kind of document to create. The Unidraw graphical editing framework [VL90] uses this approach for\nreconstructing objects saved on disk. Unidraw defines aCreator class with a\nfactory method Create that takes a class identifier as an argument. The class\nidentifier specifies the class to instantiate. When Unidraw saves an object to\ndisk, it writes out the class identifier first and then its instance variables. When it reconstructs the object from disk, it reads the class identifier first. Once the class identifier is read, the framework calls Create, passing the\nidentifier as the parameter. Create looks up the constructor for the corre-\nsponding class and uses it to instantiate the object. Last, Create calls the \nobject's Read operation, which reads the remaining information on the disk\nand initializes the object's instance variables. A parameterized factory method has the following general form, where\nMyProduct and YourProduct are subclasses of Product:\nclass Creator {\npublic:\nvirtual Product* Create(Productld);\n};\nProduct* Creator::Create (Productld id) \n{ \nif (id == MINE) return new MyProduct;\nif (id == YOURS) return new YourProduct;\n// repeat for remaining products...\nreturn 0;\n}\nOverriding a parameterized factory method lets you easily and selectively\nextend or change the products that a Creator produces. You can introduce\nnew identifiers for new kinds of products, or you can associate existing\nidentifiers with different products. For example, a subclass MyCreator could swap MyProduct and YourProd-\nuct and support a new TheirProduct subclass:\nProduct* MyCreator::Create (Productld id) \n{\nif (id == YOURS) return new MyProduct;\nif (id == MINE) \nreturn new YourProduct;\n// N.B. : switched YOURS and MINE\nif (id == THEIRS) return new TheirProduct;\nreturn Creator::Create(id); // called if all others fail\n}\nNotice that the last thing this operation does is call Create on the parent\nclass.

It isn't interested in other classes.: Hence MyCreator extends the kinds of products created, and it defers re-\nsponsibility for creating all but a few products to its parent. 3. Language-specific variants and issues. Different languages lend themselves to\nother interesting variations and caveats. Smalltalk programs often use a method that returns the class of the object\nto be instantiated. A Creator factory method can use this value to create\na product, and a ConcreteCreator may store or even compute this value. The result is an even later binding for the type of ConcreteProduct to be\ninstantiated. A Smalltalk \nversion of the Document example \ncan define a documentClass\nmethod on Application. The documentClass method returns the\nproper Document class for instantiating documents. The implementation of\ndocumentClass in MyApplication returns the MyDocument class. Thus\nin class Application we have\nclientMethod\ndocument := self documentClass \nnew. documentClass \nself subclassResponsibility\nIn class MyApplication we have\ndocumentClass\n~ MyDocument\nwhich returns the class MyDocument to be instantiated to Application. An even more flexible approach akin to parameterized factory methods is to \nstore the class to be created as a class variable of Application. That way\nyou don't have to subclass Application to vary the product. Factory methods in C++ are always virtual functions and are often pure \nvir-\ntual. Just be careful not to call factory methods in the Creator's constructor\u2014\nthe factory method in the ConcreteCreator \nwon't be available yet. You can avoid this by being careful to access products solely through acces-\nsor operations that create the product on demand. Instead of creating the\nconcrete product in the constructor, the constructor merely initializes it to 0. The accessor returns the product. But first it checks to make sure the product\nexists, and if it doesn't, the accessor creates it. This technique is sometimes\ncalled lazy initialization.

Using templates to avoid subclassing. As we've mentioned, another potential\nproblem with factory methods is that they might force you to subclass just\nto create the appropriate Product objects. Another way to get around this in\nC++ is to provide a template subclass of Creator that's parameterized by the\nProduct class:\nclass Creator {\npublic:\nvirtual Product* CreateProduct() = 0 \n;\n};\ntemplate <class TheProduct> \nclass StandardCreator: public Creator {\npublic:\nvirtual Product* CreateProduct();\n};\ntemplate <class TheProduct>\nProduct* StandardCreator<TheProduct>::CreateProduct () \n{\nreturn new TheProduct;\n}\nWith this template, the client supplies just the product class\u2014no subclassing\nof Creator is required. class MyProduct : \npublic Product {\npublic:\nMyProduct();\n// . . . };\nStandardCreator<MyProduct> myCreator;\n5.

The editor framework may have a palette of tools for adding these music\nobjects to the score. The palette would also include tools for selecting, moving,\nand otherwise manipulating music objects.

You ef-: fectively define new kinds of objects by instantiating existing classes and\nregistering the instances as prototypes of client objects. A client can exhibit\nnew behavior by delegating responsibility to the prototype. This kind of design lets users define new \"classes\" without programming. In fact, cloning a prototype is similar to instantiating a class. The Prototype\npattern can greatly \nreduce the number of classes a system needs. In our music\neditor, one GraphicTool class can create a limitless variety of music objects. 3. Specifying new objects by varying structure. Many applications build objects\nfrom parts and subparts. Editors for circuit design, for example, build cir-\ncuits out of subcircuits.1 For convenience, such applications often let you\ninstantiate complex, user-defined structures, say, to use a specific subcircuit\nagain and again. The Prototype pattern supports this as well. We \nsimply add this subcircuit as\na prototype to the palette of available circuit elements. As long as the com-\nposite circuit object implements Clone as a deep copy, circuits with different\nstructures can be prototypes. 4. Reduced subclassing. Factory Method (107) \noften produces a hierarchy of Cre-\nator classes that parallels the product class hierarchy. The Prototype pattern\nlets you clone a prototype instead of asking a factory method to make a new\nobject. Hence you don't need a Creator class hierarchy at all. This benefit\napplies primarily to languages like C++ that don't treat classes as \nfirst-class \nobjects. Languages that do, like Smalltalk and Objective C, derive less bene-\nfit, since you can always use a class object as a creator. Class objects already\nact like prototypes in these languages. 5. Configuring an application with classes dynamically. Some run-time environ-\nments let you load classes into an application dynamically. The Prototype\npattern is the key to exploiting such facilities in a language like \nC++. An application that wants to create instances of a dynamically loaded class\nwon't be able to reference its constructor statically. Instead, \nthe run-time envi-\nronment creates an instance of each class automatically \nwhen it's loaded, and\nit registers the instance with a prototype manager (see the Implementation\nsection). Then the application can ask the prototype manager for instances of\nnewly loaded classes, classes that weren't linked with the program originally.

{"text": "PROTOTYPE: 121\nImplementation\nPrototype is particularly useful with static languages like C++, where classes are\nnot objects, and little or no type information is available at run-time. It's less\nimportant in languages like Smalltalk or Objective C that provide what amounts \nto a prototype (i.e., a class object) for creating instances of each class. This pattern is\nbuilt into prototype-based languages like Self [US87], in which all object creation\nhappens by cloning a prototype. Consider the following issues when implementing prototypes:\n1. Using a prototype manager. When the number of prototypes in a system isn't\nfixed (that is, they can be created and destroyed dynamically), keep a registry\nof available prototypes. Clients won't manage prototypes themselves but will\nstore and retrieve them from the registry. A client will ask the registry for a \nprototype before cloning it. We call this registry a prototype manager. A prototype manager is an associative store that returns the prototype match-\ning a given key. It has operations for registering a prototype under a key and\nfor unregistering it. Clients can change or even browse through the registry\nat run-time. This lets clients extend and take inventory on the system without\nwriting code. 2. Implementing the Clone operation. The hardest part of the Prototype pattern\nis implementing the Clone operation correctly. It's particularly tricky when\nobject structures contain circular references. Most languages provide some support for cloning objects. For example,\nSmalltalk provides an implementation of copy that's inherited by all sub-\nclasses of Object. C++ provides a copy constructor. But these facilities don't \nsolve the \"shallow copy versus deep copy\" problem [GR83]. That is, does\ncloning an object in turn clone its instance variables, or do the clone and\noriginal just share the variables? A shallow copy is simple and often sufficient, and that's what Smalltalk\nprovides by default. The default copy constructor in C++ does a member-\nwise copy, which means pointers will be shared between the copy and the\noriginal. But cloning prototypes with complex structures usually requires a\ndeep copy, because the clone and the original must be independent. Therefore\nyou must ensure that the clone's components are clones of the prototype's \ncomponents.

The Save operation saves the object\ninto a memory buffer, and Load creates a duplicate by reconstructing the\nobject from the buffer. 3. Initializing clones.

The Singleton pattern is an improvement over global\nvariables. It avoids polluting the name space with global variables that store\nsole instances. 3.

A common way to do this is to hide the operation that\ncreates the instance behind a class operation (that is, either a static member\nfunction or a class method) that guarantees only one instance is created. This\noperation has access to the variable that holds the unique instance, and it\nensures the variable is initialized with the unique instance before returning\nits value. This approach ensures that a singleton is created and initialized\nbefore its first use. You can define the class operation in C++ with a static member function\nInstance of the Singleton class. Single \nton also defines a static member\nvariable -instance that contains a pointer to its unique instance. The Singleton class is declared as\nclass Singleton {\npublic:\nstatic Singleton* Instance();\nprotected:\nSingleton();\nprivate:\nstatic Singleton* _instance;\n};\nThe corresponding implementation is\nSingleton* Singleton::_instance = 0;\nSingleton* Singleton::Instance () \n{\nif (_instance == 0) {\n_instance = new Singleton;\n}\nreturn _instance;\n}\nClients access the singleton exclusively through the Instance member func-\ntion. The variable -instance is initialized to 0, and the static member func-\ntion Instance returns its value, initializing it with the unique instance if it\nis 0.

We'll give an example of this in the Sample Code. There's another thing to note about the C++ implementation. It isn't enough\nto define the singleton as a global or static object and then rely on automatic\ninitialization.

{"text": "(b) We might not have enough information to instantiate every singleton: at static initialization time. A singleton might require values that are\ncomputed later in the program's execution. (c) C++ doesn't define the order in which constructors for global objects are\ncalled across translation units [ES90]. This means that no dependencies\ncan exist between singletons; if any do, then errors are inevitable. An added (albeit small) liability of the global/static object approach is that\nit forces all singletons to be created whether they are used or not. Using a\nstatic member function avoids all of these problems. In Smalltalk, the function that returns the unique instance is implemented\nas a class method on the Singleton class.

That lets a C++ programmer decide the class of singleton at link-\ntime (e.g., by linking in an object file containing a different implementation)\nbut keeps it hidden from the clients of the singleton. The link approach fixes the choice of singleton class at link-time, which\nmakes it hard to choose the singleton class at run-time.

{"text": "DISCUSSION OF CREATIONAL PATTERNS: 135\nDiscussion of Creational Patterns\nThere are two common ways to parameterize a system by the classes of objects it\ncreates. One way is to subclass the class that creates the objects; this corresponds to\nusing the Factory Method (107) pattern. The main drawback of this approach is that it \ncan require creating a new subclass just to change the class of the product. Such changes\ncan cascade. For example, when the product creator is itself created by a factory method,\nthen you have to override its creator as well. The other way to parameterize a system relies more on object composition: Define an\nobject that's responsible for knowing the class of the product objects, and make it a\nparameter of the system. This is a key aspect of the Abstract Factory (87), Builder \n(97),\nand Prototype (117) patterns. All three involve creating a new \"factory object\" whose\nresponsibility is to create product objects. Abstract Factory has the factory object pro-\nducing objects of several classes. Builder has the factory object building a complex \nproduct incrementally using a correspondingly complex protocol. Prototype has the\nfactory object building a product by copying a prototype object. In this case, the factory\nobject and the prototype are the same object, because the prototype is responsible for\nreturning the product. Consider the drawing editor framework described in the Prototype pattern. There are\nseveral ways to parameterize a GraphicTool \nby the class of product:\n\u2022 By applying the Factory Method pattern, a subclass of GraphicTool \nwill be created\nfor each subclass of Graphic in the palette. GraphicTool will have a NewGraphic\noperation that each GraphicTool subclass will redefine. \u2022 By applying the Abstract Factory pattern, there will be a class hierarchy of Graph-\nicsFactories, one for each Graphic subclass. Each factory creates just one product\nin this case: CircleFactory will create Circles, LineFactory will create Lines, and\nso on. A GraphicTool \nwill be parameterized with a factory for creating the appro-\npriate kind of Graphics. \u2022 By \napplying the Prototype pattern, each subclass of Graphics will implement the\nClone operation, and a GraphicTool will be parameterized with a prototype of\nthe Graphic it creates.

{"text": "Chapter 4: Structural Patterns\nStructural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form\nlarger structures. Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or im-\nplementations. As a simple example, consider how multiple inheritance mixes two or\nmore classes into one. The result is a class that combines the properties of its parent\nclasses. This pattern is particularly useful for making independently developed class\nlibraries work together. Another example is the class form of the Adapter (139) pat-\ntern. In general, an adapter makes one interface (the adaptee's) conform to another,\nthereby providing a uniform abstraction of different interfaces. A class adapter accom-\nplishes this by inheriting privately from an adaptee class. The adapter then expresses\nits interface in terms of the adaptee's. Rather than composing interfaces or implementations, structural object patterns de-\nscribe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality. The added flexibility of\nobject composition comes from the ability to change the composition at run-time, which\nis impossible with static class composition. Composite (163) is an example of a structural object pattern. It describes how to build\na class hierarchy made up of classes for two kinds of objects: primitive and composite. The composite objects let you compose primitive and other composite objects into\narbitrarily complex structures. In the Proxy (207) \npattern, a proxy acts as a convenient\nsurrogate or placeholder for another object. A proxy can be used in many ways. It can\nact as a local representative for an object in a remote address space. It can represent\na large object that should be loaded on demand. It might protect access to a sensitive\nobject. Proxies provide a level of indirection to specific properties of objects. Hence they\ncan restrict, enhance, or alter these properties. The Flyweight (195) pattern defines a structure for sharing objects. Objects are shared\nfor at least two reasons: efficiency and consistency. Flyweight focuses on sharing for\nspace efficiency. Applications that use lots of objects must pay careful attention to\nthe cost of each object. Substantial savings can be had by sharing objects instead of\nreplicating them. But objects can be shared only if they don't define context-dependent\n137", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 157", "position": 157, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 362}

The facade carries out its responsibilities by forwarding messages to the\nobjects it represents. The Bridge (151) pattern separates an object's abstraction from its\nimplementation so that you can vary them independently. Decorator (175) describes how to add responsibilities to objects dynamically. Decorator\nis a structural pattern that composes objects \nrecursively to allow an open-ended number\nof additional responsibilities. For example, a Decorator object containing a user interface\ncomponent can add a decoration like a border or shadow to the component, or it can\nadd functionality like scrolling and zooming. We can add two decorations simply by\nnesting one Decorator object within another, and so on for additional decorations. To \naccomplish this, each Decorator object must conform to the interface of its component\nand must forward messages to it. The Decorator can do its job (such as drawing a\nborder around the component) either before or after forwarding a message. Many structural patterns are related to some degree.

Adapter lets\nclasses work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible \ninterfaces. Also Known As\nWrapper\nMotivation\nSometimes a toolkit class that's designed for reuse isn't reusable only because its\ninterface doesn't match the domain-specific interface an application requires. Consider for example a drawing editor that lets users draw and arrange graphical\nelements (lines, polygons, text, etc.) into pictures and diagrams. The drawing\neditor's key abstraction is the graphical object, which has an editable shape and\ncan draw itself. The interface for graphical objects is defined by an abstract class\ncalled Shape. The editor defines a subclass of Shape for each kind of graphical\nobject: a LineShape class for lines, a PolygonShape class for polygons, and so\nforth. Classes for elementary geometric shapes like LineShape and PolygonShape are\nrather easy to implement, because their drawing and editing capabilities are \ninherently limited. But a TextShape subclass that can display and edit text is\nconsiderably more difficult to implement, since even basic text editing involves\ncomplicated screen update and buffer management. Meanwhile, an off-the-shelf\nuser interface toolkit might already provide a sophisticated TextView class for\ndisplaying and editing text. Ideally we'd like to reuse TextView to implement\nTextShape, but the toolkit wasn't designed with Shape classes in mind. So we\ncan't use TextView and Shape objects \ninterchangeably. How can existing and unrelated classes like TextView work in an application that\nexpects classes with a different and incompatible interface? We could change the\nTextView class so that it conforms to the Shape interface, but that isn't an option\nunless we have the toolkit's source code. Even if we did, it wouldn't make sense to\nchange TextView; the toolkit shouldn't have to adopt domain-specific \ninterfaces\njust to make one application work. Instead, we could define TextShape so that it adapts the TextView interface to\nShape's. We can do this in one of two ways: (1) by inheriting Shape's interface\nand Text \nView's implementation or (2) by composing a TextView instance within\na TextShape \nand implementing TextShape \nin terms of Text \nView's interface.

{"text": "1. Implementing class adapters in C++. In a C++ implementation of a class adapter,: Adapter would inherit publicly from Target and privately from Adaptec. Thus Adapter would be a subtype of Target but not of Adaptec. 2. Pluggable adapters. Let's look at three ways to implement pluggable adapters\nfor the TreeDisplay widget described earlier, which can lay out and display\na hierarchical structure automatically. The first step, which is common to all three of the implementations discussed\nhere, is to find a \"narrow\" interface for Adaptec, that is, the smallest subset\nof operations that lets us do the adaptation. A narrow interface consisting of\nonly a couple of operations is easier to adapt than an interface with dozens\nof operations. For TreeDisplay, the adaptee is any hierarchical structure. A\nminimalist interface might include two operations, one that defines how to\npresent a node in the hierarchical structure graphically, and another that\nretrieves the node's children. The narrow interface leads to three implementation approaches:\n(a) Using abstract operations. Define corresponding abstract operations for the\nnarrow Adaptee interface in the TreeDisplay class. Subclasses must im-\nplement the abstract operations and adapt the hierarchically structured\nobject. For example, a DirectoryTreeDisplay subclass will implement\nthese operations by accessing the directory structure. DirectoryTreeDisplay specializes the narrow interface so that it can dis-\nplay directory structures made up of FileSystemEntity objects. (b) Using delegate objects. In this approach, TreeDisplay forwards \nrequests for\naccessing the hierarchical structure to a delegate object. TreeDisplay \ncan\nuse a different adaptation strategy by substituting a different delegate. For example, suppose there exists a DirectoryBrowser that uses a Tree-\nDisplay. DirectoryBrowser might make a good delegate for adapting\nTreeDisplay to the hierarchical directory structure. In dynamically typed\nlanguages like Smalltalk or Objective C, this approach only requires an\ninterface for registering the delegate with the adapter.

{"text": "ADAPTED: 145\nsimply forwards the requests to the delegate. NEXTSTEP [Add94] uses\nthis approach heavily to reduce subclassing.

We use\nsingle inheritance if the DirectoryBrowser has no existing parent class,\nmultiple inheritance if it does. Mixing classes together like this is eas-\nier than introducing a new TreeDisplay subclass and implementing its\noperations individually. (c) Parameterized adapters. The usual way to support pluggable adapters in\nSmalltalk is to parameterize an adapter with one or more blocks. The\nblock construct supports adaptation without subclassing. A block can\nadapt a request, and the adapter can store a block for each individual\nrequest. In our example, this means TreeDisplay stores one block for\nconverting a node into a GraphicNode and another block for accessing\na node's children.

This, in turn, makes it harder to port the client\ncode to other \nplatforms. Clients should be able to create a window without committing to a con-\ncrete implementation. Only the window implementation should depend on\nthe platform on which the application runs. Therefore client code should\ninstantiate windows without mentioning specific platforms. The Bridge \npattern addresses these problems by putting the Window abstraction\nand its implementation in separate class hierarchies. There is one class hierarchy\nfor window interfaces (Window, \nIconWindow, TransientWindow) and a separate\nhierarchy for platform-specific window implementations, with Windowlmp as its\nroot. The XWindowImp subclass, for example, provides an implementation based\non the X Window System. All operations on Window subclasses are implemented in terms of abstract oper-\nations from the Windowlmp interface.

{"text": "BRIDGE: 155\nImplementation\nConsider the following implementation issues when applying the Bridge pattern:\n1. Only one Implementor. In situations where there's only one implementation,\ncreating an abstract Implementor class isn't necessary. This is a degenerate\ncase of the Bridge pattern; there's a one-to-one relationship between Ab-\nstraction and Implementor. Nevertheless, this separation is still useful when\na change in the implementation of a class must not affect its existing clients\u2014\nthat is, they shouldn't have to be recompiled, just relinked. Carolan [Car89] uses the term \"Cheshire Cat\" to describe this separation. In\nC++, the class interface of the Implementor class can be defined in a private\nheader file that isn't provided to clients. This lets you hide an implementation \nof a class completely from its clients. 2. Creating the right Implementor object. How, when, and where do you decide\nwhich Implementor class to instantiate when there's more than one? If Abstraction knows about all Concretelmplementor classes, then it can\ninstantiate one of them in its constructor; it can decide between them based\non parameters passed to its constructor. If, for example, a collection class\nsupports multiple implementations, the decision can be based on the size of\nthe collection. A linked list implementation can be used for small collections\nand a hash table for larger ones. Another approach is to choose a default implementation initially and change\nit later according to usage. For example, if the collection grows bigger than\na certain threshold, then it switches its implementation to one that's more\nappropriate for a large number of items. It's also possible to delegate the decision to another object altogether. In\nthe Window/Windowlmp example, we can introduce a factory object (see\nAbstract Factory (87)) whose sole duty is to encapsulate platform-specifics. The factory knows what kind of Windowlmp object to create for the platform\nin use; a Window simply asks it for a Windowlmp, and it returns the right\nkind. A benefit of this approach is that Abstraction is not coupled directly to\nany of the Implementor classes. 3. Sharing implementors. Coplien illustrates how the Handle/Body idiom in \nC++\ncan be used to share implementations among several objects [Cop92]. The\nBody stores a reference count that the Handle class increments and decre-\nments. The code for assigning handles with shared bodies has the following\ngeneral form:", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Domain-Driven Design", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 175", "position": 175, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 385}

It\nworks in cases where children can avoid sending parent requests by exter-\nnalizing some or all of their state. 3. Maximizing the Component interface. One of the goals of the Composite pattern\nis to make clients unaware of the specific Leaf or Composite classes they're\nusing. To \nattain this goal, the Component class should define as many com-\nmon operations for Composite and Leaf classes as possible. The Component\nclass usually provides default implementations for these operations, and\nLeaf and Composite subclasses will override them. However, this goal will sometimes conflict with the principle of class hierar-\nchy design that says a class should only define operations that are meaningful \nto its subclasses. There are many operations that Component supports that\ndon't seem to make sense for Leaf classes. How can Component provide a\ndefault implementation for them? Sometimes a little creativity shows how an operation that would appear to\nmake sense only for Composites can be implemented for all Components by\nmoving it to the Component class. For example, the interface for accessing\nchildren is a fundamental part of a Composite class but not necessarily Leaf\nclasses. But if we view a Leaf as a Component that never has children, then we\ncan define a default operation for child access in the Component class that\nnever returns any children. Leaf classes can use the default implementation,\nbut Composite classes will reimplement it to return their children. The child management operations are more troublesome and are discussed\nin the next item. 4. Declaring the child management operations. Although the Composite class imple-\nments the Add and Remove operations for managing children, an important\nissue in the Composite pattern is which classes declare these operations in the\nComposite class hierarchy. Should we declare these operations in the Com-\nponent and make them meaningful for Leaf classes, or should we declare\nand define them only in Composite and its subclasses?

{"text": "COMPOSITE: 169\nThe only way to provide transparency is to define default Add and Remove\noperations in Component. That creates a new problem: There's no way to im-\nplement Component: : \nAdd \nwithout introducing the possibility of it failing. You could make it do nothing, but that ignores an important consideration;\nthat is, an attempt to add something to a leaf probably indicates a bug. In\nthat case, the Add operation produces garbage. You could make it delete its\nargument, but that might not be what clients expect. Usually it's better to make Add and Remove fail by default (perhaps by\nraising an exception) if the component isn't allowed to have children or if\nthe argument of Remove isn't a child of the component, respectively. Another alternative is to change the meaning of \"remove\" slightly. If\nthe component maintains a parent reference, then we could redefine \nComponent: : \nRemove to remove itself from its parent. However, there still\nisn't a meaningful interpretation for a corresponding Add. 5. Should Component implement a list of Components? You might be tempted to\ndefine the set of children as an instance variable in the Component class\nwhere the child access and management operations are declared. But putting\nthe child pointer in the base class incurs a space penalty for every leaf, even\nthough a leaf never has children. This is worthwhile only if there are \nrelatively\nfew children in the structure. 6. Child ordering. Many designs specify an ordering on the children of Com-\nposite. In the earlier Graphics example, ordering may reflect front-to-back\nordering. If Composites represent parse trees, then compound statements\ncan be instances of a Composite whose children must be ordered to reflect\nthe program. When child ordering is an issue, you must design child access and man-\nagement interfaces carefully to manage the sequence of children. The Itera-\ntor (257) \npattern can guide you in this. 7. Caching to improve performance. If you need to traverse or search compositions\nfrequently, the Composite class can cache traversal or search information\nabout its children. The Composite can cache actual results or just \ninformation\nthat lets it short-circuit the traversal or search. For example, the Picture class\nfrom the Motivation example could cache the bounding box of its children.

It may optionally per-\nform additional operations before and after forwarding the request. Consequences\nThe Decorator pattern has at least two key benefits and two liabilities:\n1. More flexibility than static inheritance. The Decorator pattern provides a more\nflexible way to add responsibilities to objects than can be had with static\n(multiple) inheritance. With decorators, responsibilities can be added and\nremoved at run-time simply by attaching and detaching them. In contrast,\ninheritance requires creating a new class for each additional responsibil-\nity (e.g., BorderedScrollableTextView, BorderedTextView). This gives rise to\nmany classes and increases the complexity of a system. Furthermore, provid-\ning different Decorator classes for a specific Component class lets you mix\nand match responsibilities. Decorators also make it easy to add a property twice. For example, to give\na Text \nView a double border, simply attach two BorderDecorators. Inheriting \nfrom a Border class twice is error-prone at best. 2. Avoids feature-laden classes high up in the hierarchy. Decorator offers a pay-\nas-you-go approach to adding responsibilities. Instead of trying to support\nall foreseeable features in a complex, customizable class, you can define\na simple class and add functionality incrementally with Decorator objects. Functionality can be composed from simple pieces. As a result, an application\nneedn't pay for features it doesn't use. It's also easy to define new kinds of\nDecorators independently from the classes of objects they extend, even for\nunforeseen extensions. Extending a complex class tends to expose details\nunrelated to the responsibilities you're adding. 3. A decorator and its component aren't identical. A decorator acts as a transparent\nenclosure. But from an object identity point of view, a decorated component\nis not identical to the component itself. Hence you shouldn't rely on object\nidentity when you use decorators. 4. Lots of little objects. A design that uses Decorator often results in systems\ncomposed of lots of little objects that all look alike. The objects differ only\nin the way they are interconnected, not in their class or in the value of\ntheir variables. Although these systems are easy to customize by those who\nunderstand them, they can be hard to learn and debug.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Domain-Driven Design", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 198", "position": 198, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 375}
{"text": "DECORATOR: 179\nImplementation\nSeveral issues should be considered when applying the Decorator pattern:\n1. Interface conformance. A decorator object's interface must conform to the inter-\nface of the component it decorates. ConcreteDecorator \nclasses must therefore\ninherit from a common class (at least in \nC++). 2. Omitting the abstract Decorator class. There's no need to define an abstract\nDecorator class when you only need to add one responsibility. That's often\nthe case when you're dealing with an existing class hierarchy rather than\ndesigning a new one. In that case, you can merge Decorator's responsibility\nfor forwarding requests to the component into the \nConcreteDecorator. 3. Keeping Component classes lightweight. To ensure a conforming \ninterface, com-\nponents and decorators must descend from a common Component class. It's important to keep this common class lightweight; that is, it should fo-\ncus on defining an interface, not on storing data. The definition of the data\nrepresentation should be deferred to subclasses; otherwise the complexity\nof the Component class might make the decorators too heavyweight to use\nin quantity. Putting a lot of functionality into Component also increases the\nprobability that concrete subclasses will pay for features they don't need. 4. Changing the skin of an object versus changing its guts. We can think of a deco-\nrator as a skin over an object that changes its behavior. An alternative is to\nchange the object's guts. The Strategy (315) pattern is a good example of a\npattern for changing the guts. Strategies are a better choice in situations where the Component class is\nintrinsically heavyweight, thereby making the Decorator pattern too costly\nto apply. In the Strategy \npattern, the component forwards some of its behavior\nto a separate strategy object. The Strategy pattern lets us alter or extend the\ncomponent's functionality by replacing the strategy object. For example, we can support different border styles by having the component\ndefer border-drawing to a separate Border object. The Border object is a\nStrategy object that encapsulates a border-drawing strategy. By extending\nthe number of strategies from just one to an open-ended list, we achieve the\nsame effect as nesting decorators \nrecursively. In MacApp 3.0 [App89] and Bedrock [Sym93a], for example, graphical com-\nponents (called \"views\") maintain a list of \"adorner\" objects that can attach\nadditional adornments like borders to a view component.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 199", "position": 199, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 384}

Motivation\nStructuring a system into subsystems helps reduce complexity. A common design\ngoal is to minimize the communication and dependencies between subsystems. One way to achieve this goal is to introduce a facade object that provides a single,\nsimplified interface to the more general facilities of a subsystem. Consider for example a programming environment that gives applications access\nto its compiler subsystem. This subsystem contains classes such as Scanner, Parser,\nProgramNode, BytecodeStream, and ProgramNodeBuilder that implement the\ncompiler. Some specialized applications might need to access these classes directly. But most clients of a compiler generally don't care about details like parsing and\ncode generation; they merely want to compile some code. For them, the powerful\nbut low-level interfaces in the compiler subsystem only complicate their task. To provide a higher-level interface that can shield clients from these classes, the\ncompiler subsystem also includes a Compiler class. This class defines a unified\ninterface to the compiler's functionality. The Compiler class acts as a facade: It\noffers clients a single, simple interface to the compiler subsystem.

This has\na major impact on how the objects in the hierarchy communicate with each other. Implementation\nConsider the following issues when implementing the Flyweight pattern:\n1. Removing extrinsic state. The pattern's applicability is determined largely by\nhow easy it is to identify extrinsic state and remove it from shared objects. Removing extrinsic state won't help reduce storage costs if there are as many\ndifferent kinds of extrinsic state as there are objects before sharing.

In a typical case, a document containing 180,000 \ncharacters\nrequired allocation of only 480 character objects. ET++ [WGM88] uses flyweights to support look-and-feel independence.5 The\nlook-and-feel standard affects the layout of user interface elements (e.g., scroll\nbars, buttons, menus\u2014known collectively as \"widgets\") and their decorations\n(e.g., shadows, beveling). A widget delegates all its layout and drawing behavior\nto a separate Layout object. Changing the Layout object changes the look and feel,\neven at run-time. For each widget class there is a corresponding Layout class (e.g., ScrollbarLayout,\nMenubarLayout, etc.). An obvious problem with this approach is that using sep-\narate layout objects doubles the number of user interface objects: For each user\ninterface object there is an additional Layout object. To avoid this overhead, Lay-\nout objects are implemented as flyweights. They make good flyweights because\nthey deal mostly with defining behavior, and it's easy to pass them what little\nextrinsic state they need to lay out or draw an object. The Layout objects are created and managed by Look objects. The Look class is\nan Abstract Factory (87) that retrieves a specific Layout object with operations \nlike GetButtonLayout, GetMenuBarLayout, and so forth. For each look-and-feel\nstandard there is a corresponding Look subclass (e.g., MotifLook, OpenLook) that\nsupplies the appropriate Layout \nobjects. By the way, Layout objects are essentially strategies (see Strategy (315)). They are\nan example of a strategy object implemented as a flyweight. Related Patterns\nThe Flyweight pattern is often combined with the Composite (163) pattern to\nimplement a logically hierarchical structure in terms of a directed-acyclic graph\nwith shared leaf nodes. It's often best to implement State (305) and Strategy (315) objects as flyweights. 4 In the Sample Code given earlier, style information is made extrinsic, leaving the character code as the\nonly intrinsic state. 5 See Abstract Factory (87) for another approach to look-and-feel independence.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Domain-Driven Design", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 226", "position": 226, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 375}

{"text": "Object Structural: Intent\nProvide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. Also Known As\nSurrogate\nMotivation\nOne reason for controlling access to an object is to defer the full cost of its creation\nand initialization until we actually need to use it. Consider a document editor\nthat can embed graphical objects \nin a document. Some graphical objects, like large\nraster images, can be expensive to create. But opening a document should be fast,\nso we should avoid creating all the expensive objects at once when the document\nis opened. This isn't necessary anyway, because not all of these objects will be\nvisible in the document at the same time. These constraints would suggest creating each expensive object on demand, which\nin this case occurs when an image becomes visible. But what do we put in the\ndocument in place of the image? And how can we hide the fact that the image is\ncreated on demand so that we don't complicate \nthe editor's implementation? This\noptimization shouldn't impact the rendering and formatting code, for example. The solution is to use another object, an image proxy, that acts as a stand-in for\nthe real image. The proxy acts \njust like the image and takes care of instantiating it\nwhen it's required. The image proxy creates the real image only when the document editor asks it\nto display itself by invoking its Draw operation. The proxy forwards subsequent\nrequests directly to the image. It must therefore keep a reference to the image after\ncreating it. Let's assume that images are stored in separate files. In this case we can use the\nfile name as the reference to the real object. The proxy also stores its extent, that", "domains": ["Design Patterns"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 227", "position": 227, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 290}

The following class diagram illustrates this example in more detail. The document editor accesses embedded images through the interface defined by\nthe abstract Graphic class. ImageProxy is a class for images that are created on\ndemand. ImageProxy maintains the file name as a reference to the image on disk. The file name is passed as an argument to the ImageProxy \nconstructor. ImageProxy also stores the bounding box of the image and a reference to the\nreal Image instance. This reference won't be valid until the proxy instantiates\nthe real image. The Draw operation makes sure the image is instantiated before\nforwarding it the request. GetExtent \nforwards the request to the image only if it's\ninstantiated; otherwise ImageProxy returns the extent it stores. Applicability\nProxy is applicable whenever there is a need for a more versatile or sophisticated\nreference to an object than a simple pointer. Here are several common situations\nin which the Proxy pattern is applicable:\n1. A remote proxy provides a local representative for an object in a different\naddress space.

That means you can't use it exactly like a real pointer to\nan Image. Hence clients must treat Image and ImagePtr objects differently\nin this approach. Overloading the member access operator isn't a good solution for every kind\nof proxy. Some proxies need to know precisely which operation is called, and\noverloading the member access operator doesn't work in those cases. Consider the virtual proxy example in the Motivation. The image should\nbe loaded at a specific time\u2014namely when the Draw operation is called\u2014\nand not whenever the image is referenced. Overloading the access operator\ndoesn't allow this distinction. In that case we must manually implement each\nproxy operation that forwards the request to the subject. These operations are usually very similar to each other, as the Sample Code\ndemonstrates. Typically all operations verify that the request is legal, that\nthe original object exists, etc., before forwarding the request to the subject. It's tedious to write this code again and again. So it's common to use a\npreprocessor to generate it automatically. 2. Using doesNotUnderstand in Smalltalk. Smalltalk provides a hook that\nyou can use to support automatic forwarding of requests. Smalltalk calls\ndoesNotUnderstand: aMessage when a client sends a message to a\nreceiver that has no corresponding method. The Proxy class can redefine\ndoesNotUnderstand so that the message is forwarded to its subject. To ensure that a request is forwarded to the subject and not just absorbed\nby the proxy silently, you can define a Proxy class that doesn't understand\nany messages. Smalltalk lets you do this by defining Proxy as a class with no\nsuperclass.6\nThe main disadvantage of doesNotUnderstand: is that most Smalltalk\nsystems have a few special messages that are handled directly by the virtual\nmachine, and these do not cause the usual method look-up. The only one\nthat's usually implemented in Object (and so can affect proxies) is the identity\noperation ==.

{"text": "DISCUSSION OF STRUCTURAL PATTERNS: 219\nDiscussion of Structural Patterns\nYou may have noticed similarities between the structural patterns, especially in their\nparticipants and collaborations. This is so probably because structural patterns rely on\nthe same small set of language mechanisms for structuring code and objects: single\nand multiple inheritance for class-based patterns, and object composition for object\npatterns. But the similarities belie the different intents among these patterns. In this\nsection we compare and contrast groups of structural patterns to give you a feel for\ntheir relative merits. Adapter versus Bridge\nThe Adapter (139) and Bridge (151) patterns have some common attributes. Both pro-\nmote flexibility by providing a level of indirection to another object. Both involve\nforwarding requests to this object from an interface other than its own. The key difference between these patterns lies in their intents. Adapter focuses on\nresolving incompatibilities between two existing interfaces. It doesn't focus on how\nthose interfaces are implemented, nor does it consider how they might evolve inde-\npendently. It's a way of making two independently designed classes work together\nwithout reimplementing one or the other. Bridge, on the other hand, bridges an ab-\nstraction and its (potentially numerous) implementations. It provides a stable interface\nto clients even as it lets you vary the classes that implement it. It also accommodates\nnew implementations as the system evolves. As a result of these differences, Adapter and Bridge are often used at different points\nin the software lifecycle. An adapter often becomes necessary when you discover that\ntwo incompatible classes should work together, generally to avoid replicating code. The\ncoupling is unforeseen. In contrast, the user of a bridge understands up-front that an\nabstraction must have several implementations, and both may evolve independently.

{"text": "composite, but that misses the point of the Decorator pattern. The similarity ends at: recursive composition, again because of differing intents. Decorator is designed to let you add responsibilities to objects without subclassing. It\navoids the explosion of subclasses that can arise from trying to cover every combination\nof responsibilities statically. Composite has a different intent. It focuses on structuring\nclasses so that many related objects can be treated uniformly, and multiple objects can\nbe treated as one. Its focus is not on embellishment but on representation. These intents are distinct but complementary. Consequently, the Composite and Deco-\nrator patterns are often used in concert. Both lead to the kind of design in which you can \nbuild applications just by plugging objects together without defining any new classes. There will be an abstract class with some subclasses that are composites, some that are\ndecorators, and some that implement the fundamental building blocks of the system. In this case, both composites and decorators will have a common interface. From the\npoint of view of the Decorator pattern, a composite is a ConcreteComponent. From the \npoint of view of the Composite pattern, a decorator is a Leaf. Of course, they don't have\nto be used together and, as we have seen, their intents are quite different. Another pattern with a structure similar to Decorator's is Proxy (207). Both patterns\ndescribe how to provide a level of indirection to an object, and the implementations of\nboth the proxy and decorator object keep a reference to another object to which they\nforward requests. Once again, however, they are intended for different purposes. Like Decorator, the Proxy pattern composes an object and provides an identical in-\nterface to clients. Unlike Decorator, the Proxy pattern is not concerned with attaching\nor detaching properties dynamically, and it's not designed for recursive composition. Its intent is to provide a stand-in for a subject when it's inconvenient or undesirable\nto access the subject directly because, for example, it lives on a remote machine, has\nrestricted access, or is persistent. In the Proxy \npattern, the subject \ndefines the key functionality, and the proxy provides (or\nrefuses) access to it. In Decorator, the component provides only part of the functionality,\nand one or more decorators furnish the rest.

{"text": "Chapter 5: Behavioral Patterns\nBehavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibili-\nties between objects. Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes\nbut also the patterns of communication between them. These patterns characterize\ncomplex control flow that's difficult to follow at run-time. They shift your focus away\nfrom flow of control to let you concentrate \njust on the way objects are interconnected. Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes. This\nchapter includes two such patterns. Template Method (325) is the simpler and more\ncommon of the two. A template method is an abstract definition of an algorithm. It\ndefines the algorithm step by step. Each step invokes either an abstract operation or\na primitive operation. A subclass fleshes out the algorithm by defining the abstract\noperations. The other behavioral class pattern is Interpreter (243), which represents\na grammar as a class hierarchy and implements an interpreter as an operation on\ninstances of these classes. Behavioral object patterns use object composition rather than inheritance. Some de-\nscribe how a group of peer objects cooperate to perform a task that no single object\ncan carry out by itself. An important issue here is how peer objects know about each\nother. Peers could maintain explicit references to each other, but that would increase\ntheir coupling. In the extreme, every object would know about every other. The Me-\ndiator (273) pattern avoids this by introducing a mediator object between peers. The\nmediator provides the indirection needed for loose coupling. Chain of Responsibility (223) provides even looser coupling. It lets you send requests to\nan object implicitly through a chain of candidate objects. Any candidate may fulfill the\nrequest depending on run-time conditions. The number of candidates is open-ended,\nand you can select which candidates participate in the chain at run-time. The Observer (293) \npattern defines and maintains a dependency between objects.

Chain the receiving objects and pass the\nrequest along the chain until an object handles it. Motivation\nConsider a context-sensitive help facility for a graphical user interface. The user\ncan obtain help information on any part of the interface just by clicking on it. The help that's provided depends on the part of the interface that's selected and\nits context; for example, a button widget in a dialog box might have different\nhelp information than a similar button in the main window. If no specific help\ninformation exists for that part of the interface, then the help system should\ndisplay a more general help message about the immediate context\u2014the dialog\nbox as a whole, for example. Hence it's natural to organize help information according to its generality\u2014from\nthe most specific to the most general. Furthermore, it's clear that a help request\nis handled by one of several user interface objects; which one depends on the\ncontext and how specific the available help is. The problem here is that the object that ultimately provides the help isn't known\nexplicitly to the object (e.g., the button) that initiates the help request. What we\nneed is a way to decouple the button that initiates the help request from the objects\nthat might provide help information. The Chain of Responsibility pattern defines\nhow that happens.

Collaborations\n\u2022 When a client issues a request, the request propagates along the chain until a\nConcreteHandler object takes responsibility for handling it. Consequences\nChain of Responsibility has the following benefits and liabilities:\n1. Reduced coupling. The pattern frees an object from knowing which other\nobject handles a request. An object only has to know that a request will be\nhandled \"appropriately.\" Both the receiver and the sender have no explicit\nknowledge of each other, and an object in the chain doesn't have to know\nabout the chain's structure. As a result, Chain of Responsibility can simplify object interconnections. Instead of objects maintaining references to all candidate receivers, they\nkeep a single reference to their successor. 2. Added flexibility in assigning responsibilities to objects. Chain of Responsibility \ngives you added flexibility in distributing responsibilities among objects. You can add or change responsibilities for handling a request by adding\nto or otherwise changing the chain at run-time. You can combine this with\nsubclassing to specialize handlers statically. 3. Receipt isn't guaranteed. Since a request has no explicit receiver, there's no\nguarantee it'll be handled\u2014the request can fall off the end of the chain without\never being handled. A request can also go unhandled when the chain is not\nconfigured properly. Implementation\nHere are implementation issues to consider in Chain of Responsibility:\n1. Implementing the successor chain. There are two possible ways to implement\nthe successor chain:\n(a) Define new links (usually in the Handler, but ConcreteHandlers could\ndefine them instead).", "domains": ["Design Patterns"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 246", "position": 246, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 297}
{"text": "CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY: 227\n(b) Use existing links. Our examples so far define new links, but often you can use existing object\nreferences to form the successor chain. For example, parent references in a\npart-whole hierarchy can define a part's successor. A widget structure might\nalready have such links. Composite (163) \ndiscusses parent references in more\ndetail. Using existing links works well when the links support the chain you need. It saves you from defining links explicitly, and it saves space. But if the\nstructure doesn't reflect the chain of responsibility your application requires,\nthen you'll have to define redundant links. 2. Connecting successors. If there are no preexisting references for defining a\nchain, then you'll have to introduce them yourself. In that case, the Handler\nnot only defines the interface for the requests but usually maintains the\nsuccessor as well. That lets the handler provide a default implementation \nof HandleRequest that forwards the request to the successor (if any). If a\nConcreteHandler subclass isn't interested in the request, it doesn't have to\noverride the forwarding operation, since its default implementation forwards\nunconditionally. Here's a HelpHandler base class that maintains a successor link:\nclass HelpHandler {\npublic:\nHelpHandler(HelpHandler* s) : \n_successor(s) { \n}\nvirtual void HandleHelp();\nprivate:\nHelpHandler* _successor;\n};\nvoid HelpHandler::HandleHelp () \n{\nif (_successor) {\n_successor->HandleHelp();\n}\n}\n3. Representing requests. Different options are available \nfor representing requests. In the simplest form, the request is a hard-coded operation invocation, as in\nthe case of HandleHelp. This is convenient and safe, but you can forward\nonly the fixed set of requests that the Handler class defines. An alternative is to use a single handler function that takes a request code\n(e.g., an integer constant or a string) as parameter. This supports an open-\nended set of requests. The only requirement is that the sender and receiver\nagree on how the request should be encoded. This approach is more flexible, but it requires conditional statements for\ndispatching the request based on its code. Moreover, there's no type-safe\nway to pass parameters, so they must be packed and unpacked manually.

You can use the doesNotUnderstand\nmechanism in Smalltalk to forward requests. Messages that have\nno corresponding methods are trapped in the implementation of\ndoesNotUnderstand, which can be overridden to forward the message\nto an object's successor. Thus it isn't necessary to implement forwarding\nmanually; the class handles only the request in which it's interested, and it\nrelies on doesNotUnderstand to forward all others. Sample Code\nThe following example illustrates how a chain of responsibility can handle re-\nquests for an on-line help system like the one described earlier.

Known Uses\nSeveral class libraries use the Chain of Responsibility pattern to handle user\nevents. They use different names for the Handler class, but the idea is the same:\nWhen the user clicks the mouse or presses a key, an event gets generated and\npassed along the chain. MacApp [App89] and ET++ [WGM88] call it \"Event-\nHandler,\" Symantec's TCL library [Sym93b] calls it \"Bureaucrat,\" and NeXT's\nAppKit [Add94] uses the name \"Responder.\" The Unidraw framework for graphical editors defines Command objects that\nencapsulate requests to Component and Component \nView objects [VL90]. Com-\nmands are requests in the sense that a component or component view may in-\nterpret a command to perform an operation. This corresponds to the \"requests\nas objects\" approach described in Implementation. Components and component\nviews may be structured hierarchically. A component or a component view may\nforward command interpretation to its parent, which may in turn forward it to its\nparent, and so on, thereby forming a chain of responsibility. ET++ uses Chain of Responsibility to handle graphical update. A graphical object\ncalls the InvalidateRect operation whenever it must update a part of its appear-\nance. A graphical object can't handle InvalidateRect by itself, because it doesn't\nknow enough about its context. For example, a graphical object can be enclosed\nin objects like Scrollers or Zoomers that transform its coordinate system. That \nmeans the object might be scrolled or zoomed so that it's partially out of view. Therefore the default implementation of InvalidateRect forwards the request to\nthe enclosing container object. The last object in the forwarding chain is a Window\ninstance. By the time Window receives the request, the invalidation rectangle is\nguaranteed to be transformed properly. The Window handles InvalidateRect by\nnotifying the window system interface and requesting an update. Related Patterns\nChain of Responsibility is often applied in conjunction with Composite (163).

OpenCommand's Execute operation is different: it prompts the user for a docu-\nment name, creates a corresponding Document object, adds the document to the\nreceiving application, and opens the document.

{"text": "Implementation: Consider the following issues when implementing the Command pattern:\n1. How intelligent should a command be? A command can have a wide range of\nabilities. At one extreme it merely defines a binding between a receiver and\nthe actions that carry out the request. At the other extreme it implements\neverything itself without delegating to a receiver at all. The latter extreme is\nuseful when you want to define commands that are independent of existing\nclasses, when no suitable receiver exists, or when a command knows its\nreceiver implicitly. For example, a command that creates another application\nwindow may be just as capable of creating the window as any other object. Somewhere in between these extremes are commands that have enough\nknowledge to find their receiver dynamically. 2. Supporting undo and redo. Commands can support undo and redo capabilities\nif they provide a way to reverse their execution (e.g., an Unexecute or Undo\noperation). A ConcreteCommand class might need to store additional state\nto do so. This state can include\n\u2022 the Receiver object, which actually carries out operations in response to\nthe request,\n\u2022 the arguments to the operation performed on the receiver, and\n\u2022 any original values in the receiver that can change as a result of handling\nthe request. The receiver must provide operations that let the command\nreturn the receiver to its prior state. To support one level of undo, an application needs to store only the com-\nmand that was executed last. For multiple-level undo and redo, the applica-\ntion needs a history list of commands that have been executed, where the\nmaximum length of the list determines the number of undo/redo levels. The\nhistory list stores sequences of commands that have been executed. Travers-\ning backward through the list and reverse-executing commands cancels their\neffect; traversing forward and executing commands reexecutes them. An undoable command might have to be copied before it can be placed\non the history list. That's because the command object that carried out the\noriginal request, say, from a Menultem, will perform other requests at later\ntimes. Copying is required to distinguish different invocations of the same\ncommand if its state can vary across invocations.

It also de-\nfines an ActionCallback template, parameterized by action method, that can in-\nstantiate command subclasses automatically. The THINK class library [Sym93b] also uses commands to support undoable\nactions. Commands in THINK are called \"Tasks.\" Task objects are passed along a\nChain of Responsibility (223) \nfor consumption. Unidraw's command objects are unique in that they can behave like messages. A\nUnidraw command may be sent to another object for interpretation, and the result\nof the interpration varies with the receiving object. Moreover, the receiver may\ndelegate the interpretation to another object, typically the receiver's parent in a \nlarger structure as in a Chain of Responsibility. The receiver of a Unidraw com-\nmand is thus computed rather than stored. Unidraw's interpretation mechanism\ndepends on run-time type information. Coplien describes how to implement functors, objects that are functions, in\nC++ [Cop92]. He achieves a degree of transparency in their use by overload-\ning the function call operator (operator ( ) ) .

Motivation\nIf a particular kind of problem occurs often enough, then it might be worthwhile\nto express instances of the problem as sentences in a simple language. Then you\ncan build an interpreter that solves the problem by interpreting these sentences. For example, searching for strings that match a pattern is a common problem. Regular expressions are a standard language for specifying patterns of strings. Rather than building custom algorithms to match each pattern against strings,\nsearch algorithms could interpret a regular expression that specifies a set of strings\nto match. The Interpreter pattern describes how to define a grammar for simple languages,\nrepresent sentences in the language, and interpret these sentences. In this example,\nthe pattern describes how to define a grammar for regular expressions, represent\na particular regular expression, and how to interpret that regular expression. Suppose the following grammar defines the regular expressions:\nexpression ::= literal | \nalternation | \nsequence | \nrepetition \n|\n'(' expression ')' \nalternation ::- \nexpression '\n|\n' expression \nsequence ::- expression '\n&\n' expression \nrepetition ::= expression '*' \nliteral ::- 'a' \\ \n'b' | \n'c' \n| \n... \n{ 'a' | \n'b' \n| \n'c' \n| ... \n}*\nThe symbol expression is the start symbol, and literal is a terminal symbol\ndefining simple words\nThe Interpreter pattern uses a class to represent each grammar rule. Symbols on\nthe right-hand side of the rule are instance variables of these classes.

The Interpreter pattern defines at least\none class for every rule in the grammar (grammar rules defined using BNF\nmay require multiple classes). Hence grammars containing many rules can\nbe hard to manage and maintain. Other design patterns can be applied to\nmitigate the problem (see Implementation). But when the grammar is very\ncomplex, other techniques such as parser or compiler generators are more\nappropriate. 4. Adding new ways to interpret expressions. The Interpreter pattern makes it\neasier to evaluate an expression in a new way. For example, you can support\npretty printing or type-checking an expression by defining a new operation\non the expression classes. If you keep creating new ways of interpreting an\nexpression, then consider using the Visitor (331) pattern to avoid changing\nthe grammar classes. Implementation\nThe Interpreter and Composite (163) patterns share many implementation issues. The following issues are specific to Interpreter:\n1. Creating the \nabstract syntax tree. The Interpreter pattern doesn't explain how to\ncreate an abstract syntax tree. In other words, it doesn't address parsing. The\nabstract syntax tree can be created by a table-driven parser, by a hand-crafted\n(usually recursive descent) parser, or directly by the client. 2. Defining the Interpret operation. You don't have to define the Interpret oper-\nation in the expression classes. If it's common to create a new interpreter,\nthen it's better to use the Visitor (331) pattern to put Interpret in a separate\n\"visitor\" object. For example, a grammar for a programming language will\nhave many operations on abstract syntax trees, such as as type-checking, op-\ntimization, code generation, and so on. It will be more likely to use a visitor\nto avoid defining these operations on every grammar class. 3. Sharing terminal symbols with the \nFlyweight pattern.

Moreover, you might want to traverse the\nlist in different ways, depending on what you want to accomplish. But you prob-\nably don't want to bloat the List interface with operations for different traversals,\neven if you could anticipate the ones you will need. You \nmight also need to have\nmore than one traversal pending on the same list. The Iterator pattern lets you do all this. The key idea in this pattern is to take the\nresponsibility for access and traversal out of the list object and put it into an iterator\nobject. The Iterator class defines an interface for accessing the list's elements. An\niterator object is responsible for keeping track of the current element; that is, it\nknows which elements have been traversed already. For example, a List class would call for a Listlterator with the following \nrelation-\nship between them:\nBefore you can instantiate Listlterator, you must supply the List to traverse. Once\nyou have the Listlterator instance, you can access the list's elements sequentially. The Currentltem operation returns the current element in the list, First initializes\nthe current element to the first element, Next advances the current element to\nthe next element, and IsDone tests whether we've advanced beyond the last\nelement\u2014that is, we're finished with the traversal.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Domain-Driven Design", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 277", "position": 277, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 259}

For\nexample, FilteringListlterator might provide access only to those elements that\nsatisfy specific filtering constraints.

Hence\nthe client commits to a particular aggregate structure. It would be better if we\ncould change the aggregate class without changing client code. We \ncan do this by\ngeneralizing the iterator concept to support polymorphic iteration. As an example, let's assume that we also have a SkipList implementation of a\nlist. A skiplist [Pug90] is a probabilistic data structure with characteristics similar\nto balanced trees. We want to be able to write code that works for both List and\nSkipList objects. We define an AbstractList \nclass that provides a common interface for manipulating\nlists. Similarly, we need an abstract Iterator class that defines a common iteration\ninterface. Then we can define concrete Iterator subclasses for the different list\nimplementations. As a result, the iteration mechanism becomes independent of\nconcrete aggregate classes. The remaining problem is how to create the iterator. Since we want to write code\nthat's independent of the concrete List subclasses, we cannot simply instantiate\na specific class. Instead, we make the list objects responsible for creating their\ncorresponding iterator. This requires an operation like Createlterator through\nwhich clients request an iterator object. Createlterator is an example of a factory method (see Factory Method (107)). We\nuse it here to let a client ask a list object for the appropriate iterator.

{"text": "Collaborations: \u2022 A Concretelterator keeps track of the current object in the aggregate and can\ncompute the succeeding object in the traversal. Consequences\nThe Iterator pattern has three important consequences:\n1. It supports variations in the traversal of an aggregate. Complex aggregates may\nbe traversed in many ways. For example, code generation and semantic\nchecking involve traversing parse trees. Code generation may traverse the\nparse tree inorder or preorder. Iterators make it easy to change the traversal\nalgorithm: Just replace the iterator instance with a different one. You \ncan also\ndefine Iterator subclasses to support new traversals. 2. Iterators simplify the Aggregate interface. Iterator's traversal interface obviates\nthe need for a similar interface in Aggregate, thereby simplifying the aggre-\ngate's interface. 3. More than one traversal can be pending on an aggregate. An iterator keeps track\nof its own traversal state. Therefore you can have more than one traversal in\nprogress at once. Implementation\nIterator has many implementation variants and alternatives. Some important ones\nfollow. The trade-offs often depend on the control structures your language pro-\nvides. Some languages (CLU [LG86], for example) even support this pattern di-\nrectly. 1. Who controls the iteration? A fundamental issue is deciding which party con-\ntrols the iteration, the iterator or the client that uses the iterator. When the\nclient controls the iteration, the iterator is called an external iterator, and\nwhen the iterator controls it, the iterator is an internal iterator.2 Clients that\nuse an external iterator must advance the traversal and request the next el-\nement explicitly from the iterator. In contrast, the client hands an internal\niterator an operation to perform, and the iterator applies that operation to\nevery element in the aggregate. External iterators are more \nflexible \nthan internal iterators. It's easy to compare\ntwo collections for equality with an external iterator, for example, but it's\npractically impossible with internal iterators. Internal iterators are especially\nweak in a language like C++ that does not provide anonymous functions,\nclosures, or continuations like Smalltalk and CLOS. But on the other hand,\n2Booch refers to external and internal iterators as active and passive iterators, respectively [Boo94]. The\nterms \"active\" and \"passive\" describe the role of the client, not the level of activity in the iterator.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Domain-Driven Design", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 280", "position": 280, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 373}
{"text": "ITERATOR: 261\ninternal iterators are easier to use, because they define the iteration logic for\nyou. 2. Who defines the traversal algorithm? The iterator is not the only place where the\ntraversal algorithm can be defined. The aggregate might define the traversal\nalgorithm and use the iterator to store just the state of the iteration. We call\nthis kind of iterator a cursor, since it merely points to the current position in \nthe aggregate. A client will invoke the Next operation on the aggregate with\nthe cursor as an argument, and the Next operation will change the state of\nthe cursor.3\nIf the iterator is responsible for the traversal algorithm, then it's easy to use\ndifferent iteration algorithms on the same aggregate, and it can also be easier\nto reuse the same algorithm on different aggregates. On the other hand,\nthe traversal algorithm might need to access the private variables of the\naggregate. If so, putting the traversal algorithm in the iterator violates the\nencapsulation of the aggregate. 3. How robust is the iterator? It can be dangerous to modify an aggregate while\nyou're traversing it. If elements are added or deleted from the aggregate,\nyou might end up accessing an element twice or missing it completely. A\nsimple solution is to copy the aggregate and traverse the copy, but that's too\nexpensive to do in general. A robust iterator ensures that insertions and removals won't interfere with\ntraversal, and it does it without copying the aggregate. There are many ways\nto implement robust iterators. Most rely on registering the iterator with the\naggregate. On insertion or removal, the aggregate either adjusts the internal\nstate of iterators it has produced, or it maintains information internally to\nensure proper traversal. Kofler provides a good discussion of how robust iterators are implemented\nin ET++ [Kof93]. Murray discusses the implementation of robust iterators\nfor the USL StandardComponents' List class [Mur93]. 4. Additional Iterator operations. The minimal interface to Iterator consists of\nthe operations First, Next, IsDone, and Currentltem.4 Some additional op-\nerations might prove useful. For example, ordered aggregates can have a\nPrevious operation that positions the iterator to the previous element. A\nSkipTo operation is useful for sorted or indexed collections. SkipTo positions\nthe iterator to an object matching specific criteria. 5. Using polymorphic iterators in C++.

{"text": "Polymorphic iterators have another drawback: the client is responsible for: deleting them. This is error-prone, because it's easy to forget to free a heap-\nallocated iterator object when you're finished with it. That's especially likely\nwhen there are multiple exit points in an operation. And if an exception is\ntriggered, the iterator object will never be freed. The Proxy (207) pattern provides a remedy. We can use a stack-allocated\nproxy as a stand-in for the real iterator. The proxy deletes the iterator in\nits destructor. Thus when the proxy goes out of scope, the real iterator will\nget deallocated along with it. The proxy ensures proper cleanup, even in\nthe face of exceptions. This is an application of the well-known C++ tech-\nnique \"resource allocation is initialization\" [ES90]. The Sample Code gives\nan example. 6. Iterators may have privileged access. An iterator can be viewed as an extension\nof the aggregate that created it. The iterator and the aggregate are tightly cou-\npled. We can express this close relationship in C++ by making the iterator a\nfriend of its aggregate. Then you don't need to define aggregate operations\nwhose sole purpose is to let iterators implement traversal efficiently. However, such privileged access can make defining new traversals difficult,\nsince it'll require changing the aggregate interface to add another friend. To avoid this problem, the Iterator class can include protected operations\nfor accessing important but publicly unavailable members of the aggregate. Iterator subclasses (and only Iterator subclasses) may use these protected\noperations to gain privileged access to the aggregate. 7. Iterators for composites. External iterators can be difficult to implement over\nrecursive aggregate structures like those in the Composite (163) pattern, be-\ncause a position in the structure may span many levels of nested aggregates. Therefore an external iterator has to store a path through the Composite to\nkeep track of the current object. Sometimes it's easier just to use an internal\niterator. It can record the current position simply by calling itself recursively,\nthereby storing the path implicitly in the call stack. If the nodes in a Composite have an interface for moving from a node to\nits siblings, parents, and children, then a cursor-based iterator may offer a\nbetter alternative. The cursor only needs to keep track of the current node; it\ncan rely on the node interface to traverse the Composite. Composites often need to be traversed in more than one way.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Domain-Driven Design", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 282", "position": 282, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 404}

As a final example, let's look at a possible implementa-\ntion of an internal or passive Listlterator class. Here the iterator controls\nthe iteration, and it applies an operation to each element. The issue in this case is how to parameterize the iterator with the operation\nwe want to perform on each element. C++ does not support anonymous\nfunctions or closures that other languages provide for this task. There are at \nleast two options: (1) Pass in a pointer to a function (global or static), or (2)\nrely on subclassing. In the first case, the iterator calls the operation passed\nto it at each point in the iteration. In the second case, the iterator calls an\noperation that a subclass overrides to enact specific behavior. Neither option is perfect. Often you want to accumulate state during the\niteration, and functions aren't well-suited to that; we would have to use\nstatic variables to remember the state. An Iterator subclass provides us\nwith a convenient place to store the accumulated state, like in an instance\nvariable. But creating a subclass for every different traversal is more work. Here's a sketch of the second option, which uses subclassing. We call the\ninternal iterator a ListTraverser. template <class Item>\nclass ListTraverser {\npublic:\nListTraverser(List<Item>* aList) ;\nbool Traverse();\nprotected: \nvirtual bool Processltem(const Item&) = 0;\nprivate:\nListlterator<ltem> _iterator;\n};\nListTraverser takes a List instance as a parameter.

{"text": "if (result == false) {: break;\n}\n}\n} \nreturn result;\n}\nA variant of this class could define Traverse to return if at least one item\nsatisfies the test.6\nKnown Uses\nIterators are common in object-oriented systems. Most collection class libraries\noffer iterators in one form or another. Here's an example from the Booch components [Boo94], a popular collection\nclass library. It provides both a fixed size (bounded) and dynamically growing\n(unbounded) implementation of a queue. The queue interface is defined by an\nabstract Queue class. To support polymorphic iteration over the different queue\nimplementations, the queue iterator is implemented in the terms of the abstract\nQueue class interface. This variation has the advantage that you don't need a\nfactory method to ask the queue implementations for their appropriate iterator. However, it requires the interface of the abstract Queue class to be powerful\nenough to implement the iterator efficiently. Iterators don't have to be defined as explicitly in Smalltalk. The standard collection\nclasses (Bag, Set, Dictionary, OrderedCollection, String, etc.) define an internal\niterator method do:, which takes a block (i.e., closure) as an argument. Each\nelement in the collection is bound to the local variable in the block; then the block\nis executed. Smalltalk also includes a set of Stream classes that support an iterator-\nlike interface. ReadStream is essentially an Iterator, and it can act as an external\niterator for all the sequential collections. There are no standard external iterators\nfor nonsequential collections such as Set and Dictionary. Polymorphic iterators and the cleanup Proxy described earlier are provided by\nthe ET++ container classes [WGM88]. The Unidraw graphical editing framework\nclasses use cursor-based iterators [VL90]. ObjectWindows 2.0 [Bor94] provides a class hierarchy of iterators for containers. You can iterate over different container types in the same way. The ObjectWindow\niteration syntax relies on overloading the postincrement operator ++ to advance\nthe iteration.

{"text": "Object Behavioral: Intent\nDefine an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes\nloose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it\nlets you vary their interaction independently. Motivation\nObject-oriented design encourages the distribution of behavior among objects. Such distribution can result in an object structure with many connections between\nobjects; in the worst case, every object ends up knowing about every other. Though partitioning a system into many objects generally enhances reusability,\nproliferating interconnections tend to reduce it again. Lots of interconnections\nmake it less likely that an object can work without the support of others\u2014the\nsystem acts as though it were monolithic. Moreover, it can be difficult to change\nthe system's behavior in any significant way, since behavior is distributed among\nmany objects. As a result, you may be forced to define many subclasses to cus-\ntomize the system's behavior. As an example, consider the implementation of dialog boxes in a graphical user\ninterface.

{"text": "Often there are dependencies between the widgets in the dialog. For example,: a button gets disabled when a certain entry field is empty. Selecting an entry\nin a list of choices called a list box might change the contents of an entry field. Conversely typing text into the entry field might automatically select one or more\ncorresponding entries in the list box. Once text appears in the entry field, other\nbuttons may become enabled that let the user do something with the text, such as\nchanging or deleting the thing to which it refers. Different dialog boxes will have different dependencies between widgets. So even\nthough dialogs display the same kinds of widgets, they can't simply reuse stock\nwidget classes; they have to be customized to reflect dialog-specific dependencies. Customizing them individually by subclassing will be tedious, since many classes\nare involved. You can avoid these problems by encapsulating collective behavior in a separate\nmediator object. A mediator is responsible for controlling and coordinating the\ninteractions of a group of objects. The mediator serves as an intermediary that\nkeeps objects in the group from referring to each other explicitly. The objects only\nknow the mediator, thereby reducing the number of interconnections. For example, FontDialogDirector can be the mediator between the widgets in\na dialog box. A FontDialogDirector object knows the widgets in a dialog and\ncoordinates their interaction.

{"text": "Implementation: The following implementation issues are relevant to the Mediator pattern:\n1. Omitting the abstract Mediator class.

The application architecture of Smalltalk/V for Windows is based on a media-\ntor structure [LaL94]. In that environment, an application consists of a Window\ncontaining a set of panes. The library contains several predefined Pane objects;\nexamples include TextPane, ListBox, Button, and so on. These panes can be used\nwithout subclassing.

ViewManager is\nthe Mediator, and each pane only knows its view manager, which is considered\nthe \"owner\" of the pane. Panes don't refer to each other directly. The following object diagram shows a snapshot of an application at run-time:\nSmalltalk/V uses an event mechanism for Pane-ViewManager communication. A\npane generates an event when it wants to get information from the mediator or \nwhen it wants to inform the mediator that something significant happened. An\nevent defines a symbol (e.g., #select) that identifies the event. To handle the\nevent, the view manager registers a method selector with the pane.

Another application of the Mediator pattern is in coordinating complex updates. An example is the ChangeManager class mentioned in Observer (293). Change-\nManager mediates between subjects and observers to avoid redundant updates. When an object changes, it notifies the ChangeManager, which in turn coordinates\nthe update by notifying the object's dependents. A similar application appears in the Unidraw drawing framework [VL90] and uses\na class called CSolver to enforce connectivity constraints between \"connectors.\" Objects in graphical editors can appear to stick to one another in different ways. Connectors are useful in applications that maintain connectivity automatically,\nlike diagram editors and circuit design systems. CSolver is a mediator between\nconnectors.

Implementation\nHere are two issues to consider when implementing the Memento pattern:\n1. Language support. Mementos have two interfaces: a wide one for originators\nand a narrow one for other objects. Ideally the implementation language\nwill support two levels of static protection. C++ lets you do this by making \nthe Originator a friend of Memento and making Memento's wide interface\nprivate. Only the narrow interface should be declared public. For example:\nclass State;\nclass Originator {\npublic:\nMemento* CreateMemento(); \nvoid SetMemento(const Memento*);\n// . . . private:\nState* _state; \n// internal data structures\n// . . . };\nclass Memento {\npublic:\n// narrow public interface\nvirtual ~Memento();\nprivate:\n// private members accessible only to Originator\nfriend class Originator;\nMemento();\nvoid SetState(State*);\nState* GetStateO \n; \n// . . . private:\nState* _state;\n// . - \n. };\n2. Storing incremental changes. When mementos get created and passed back to\ntheir originator in a predictable sequence, then Memento can save just the\nincremental change to the originator's internal state. For example, undoable commands in a history list can use mementos to en-\nsure that commands are restored to their exact state when they're undone\n(see Command (233)). The history list defines a specific order in which com-\nmands can be undone and redone. That means mementos can store just the\nincremental change that a command makes rather than the full state of every\nobject they affect.

{"text": "Note how the Observer object that initiates the change request postpones its: update until it gets a notification from the subject. Notify is not always called\nby the subject. It can be called by an observer or by another kind of object\nentirely. The Implementation section discusses some common variations. Consequences\nThe Observer pattern lets you vary subjects and observers independently. You\ncan reuse subjects \nwithout reusing their observers, and vice versa. It lets you add\nobservers without modifying the subject or other observers. Further benefits and liabilities of the Observer pattern include the following:\n1. Abstract coupling between Subject and Observer. All a subject knows is that it\nhas a list of observers, each conforming to the simple interface of the abstract\nObserver class. The subject doesn't know the concrete class of any observer. Thus the coupling between subjects and observers is abstract and minimal. Because Subject and Observer aren't tightly coupled, they can belong to\ndifferent layers of abstraction in a system. A lower-level subject can com-\nmunicate and inform a higher-level observer, thereby keeping the system's\nlayering intact. If Subject and Observer are lumped together, then the result-\ning object must either span two layers (and violate the layering), or it must be\nforced to live in one layer or the other (which might compromise the layering\nabstraction). 2. Support for broadcast communication. Unlike an ordinary request, the notifi-\ncation that a subject sends needn't specify its receiver. The notification is\nbroadcast automatically to all interested objects that subscribed to it. The\nsubject doesn't care how many interested objects exist; its only responsibil-\nity is to notify its observers. This gives you the freedom to add and remove \nobservers at any time. It's up to the observer to handle or ignore a notification. 3. Unexpected updates. Because observers have no knowledge of each other's\npresence, they can be blind to the ultimate cost of changing the subject. A\nseemingly innocuous operation on the subject may cause a cascade of updates \nto observers and their dependent objects. Moreover, dependency criteria that\naren't well-defined or maintained usually lead to spurious updates, which\ncan be hard to track down.

{"text": "OBSERVER: 297\n1. Mapping subjects to their observers. The simplest way for a subject to keep\ntrack of the observers it should notify is to store references to them explicitly\nin the subject. However, such storage may be too expensive when there are\nmany subjects and few observers. One solution is to trade space for time by\nusing an associative look-up (e.g., a hash table) to maintain the subject-to-\nobserver mapping. Thus a subject with no observers does not incur storage\noverhead. On the other hand, this approach increases the cost of accessing\nthe observers. 2. Observing more than one subject. It might make sense in some situations for\nan observer to depend on more than one subject. For example, a spreadsheet\nmay depend on more than one data source. It's necessary to extend the\nUpdate interface in such cases to let the observer know which subject is\nsending the notification. The subject can simply pass itself as a parameter\nin the Update operation, thereby letting the observer know which subject to\nexamine. 3. Who triggers the update? The subject and its observers rely on the notification\nmechanism to stay consistent. But what object actually calls Notify to trigger\nthe update? Here are two options:\n(a) Have state-setting operations on Subject call Notify after they change\nthe subject's state. The advantage of this approach is that clients don't \nhave to remember to call Notify on the subject. The disadvantage is that\nseveral consecutive operations will cause several consecutive updates,\nwhich may be inefficient. (b) Make clients responsible for calling Notify at the right time. The advan-\ntage here is that the client can wait to trigger the update until after a series\nof state changes has been made, thereby avoiding needless intermediate\nupdates. The disadvantage is that clients have an added responsibility\nto trigger the update. That makes errors more likely, since clients might\nforget to call Notify. 4. Dangling references to deleted subjects. Deleting a subject should not produce\ndangling references in its observers. One way to avoid dangling references\nis to make the subject notify its observers as it is deleted so that they can\nreset their reference to it.

Avoiding observer-specific update protocols: the push and pull models. Implemen-\ntations of the Observer pattern often have the subject broadcast additional\ninformation about the change. The subject passes this information as an\nargument to Update. The amount of information may vary widely. At one extreme, which we call the push model, the subject sends observers\ndetailed information about the change, whether they want it or not. At the\nother extreme is the pull model; the subject sends nothing but the most\nminimal notification, \nand observers ask for details explicitly \nthereafter. The pull model emphasizes the subject's ignorance of its observers, whereas\nthe push model assumes subjects know something about their observers'\nneeds. The push model might make observers less reusable, because Subject\nclasses make assumptions about Observer classes that might not always be\ntrue. On the other hand, the pull model may be inefficient, because Observer\nclasses must ascertain what changed without help from the Subject. 7. Specifying modifications of interest explicitly. You can improve update efficiency\nby extending the subject's registration interface to allow registering observers\nonly for specific events of interest. When such an event occurs, the subject\ninforms only those observers that have registered interest in that event. One\nway to support this uses the notion of aspects for Subject objects.

When a TCPConnection object receives requests from other objects, it\nresponds differently depending on its current state. For example, the effect of an\nOpen request depends on whether the connection is in its Closed state or its Estab-\nlished state. The State pattern describes how TCPConnection can exhibit different\nbehavior in each state. The key idea in this pattern is to introduce an abstract class called TCPState\nto represent the states of the network connection. The TCPState class declares\nan interface common to all classes that represent different operational states. Subclasses of TCPState \nimplement state-specific behavior.

Consequences\nThe State pattern has the following consequences:\n1. It localizes state-specific behavior and partitions behavior for different states. The\nState pattern puts all behavior associated with a particular state into one\nobject. Because all state-specific code lives in a State subclass, new states and\ntransitions can be added easily by defining new subclasses. An alternative is to use data values to define internal states and have Con-\ntext operations check the data explicitly. But then we'd have look-alike con-\nditional or case statements scattered throughout Context's implementation. Adding a new state could require changing several operations, which com-\nplicates maintenance. The State pattern avoids this problem but might introduce another, because\nthe pattern distributes behavior for different states across several State sub-\nclasses. This increases the number of classes and is less compact than a single\nclass. But such distribution is actually good if there are many states, which\nwould otherwise necessitate large conditional statements. Like long procedures, large conditional statements are undesirable. They're\nmonolithic and tend to make the code less explicit, which in turn makes \nthem difficult to modify and extend. The State pattern offers a better way to\nstructure state-specific code. The logic that determines the state transitions\ndoesn't reside in monolithic if or switch statements but instead is parti-\ntioned between the State subclasses. Encapsulating each state transition and\naction in a class elevates the idea of an execution state to full object status. That imposes structure on the code and makes its intent clearer. 2.

State objects can be shared. If State objects have no instance variables\u2014that is,\nthe state they represent is encoded entirely in their type\u2014then contexts can\nshare a State object. When states are shared in this way, they are essentially\nflyweights (see Flyweight (195)) with no intrinsic state, only behavior. Implementation\nThe State pattern raises a variety of implementation issues:\n1. Who defines the state transitions? The State pattern does not specify which\nparticipant defines the criteria for state transitions. If the criteria are fixed,\nthen they can be implemented entirely in the Context. It is generally more\nflexible and appropriate, however, to let the State subclasses themselves\nspecify their successor state and when to make the transition. This requires\nadding an interface to the Context that lets State objects set the Context's\ncurrent state explicitly. Decentralizing the transition logic in this way makes it easy to modify or\nextend the logic by defining new State subclasses. A disadvantage of de-\ncentralization is that one State subclass will have knowledge of at least one \nother, which introduces implementation dependencies between subclasses. 2. A table-based alternative. In C++ Programming Style [Car921, Cargill describes\nanother way to impose structure on state-driven code: He uses tables to map\ninputs to state transitions. For each state, a table maps every possible input\nto a succeeding state. In effect, this approach converts conditional code (and\nvirtual functions, in the case of the State pattern) into a table look-up. The main advantage of tables is their regularity: \nYou \ncan change the transition\ncriteria by modifying data instead of changing program code. There are some\ndisadvantages, however:\n\u2022 A table look-up is often less efficient than a (virtual) function call. \u2022 Putting transition logic into a uniform, tabular format makes the transi-\ntion criteria less explicit and therefore harder to understand. \u2022 It's usually difficult to add actions to accompany the state transitions. The table-driven approach captures the states and their transitions, but it \nmust be augmented to perform arbitrary computation on each transition. The key difference between table-driven state machines and the State pattern\ncan be summed up like this: The State pattern models state-specific behavior,\nwhereas the table-driven approach focuses on defining state transitions.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 328", "position": 328, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 402}

A common implementation trade-off\nworth considering is whether (1) to create State objects only when they are\nneeded and destroy them thereafter versus (2) creating them ahead of time\nand never destroying them. The first choice is preferable when the states that will be entered aren't\nknown at run-time, and contexts change state infrequently. This approach\navoids creating objects that won't be used, which is important if the State\nobjects store a lot of information. The second approach is better when state\nchanges occur rapidly, in which case you want to avoid destroying states,\nbecause they may be needed again shortly. Instantiation costs are paid once\nup-front, and there are no destruction costs at all. This approach might be\ninconvenient, though, because the Context must keep references to all states\nthat might be entered. 4. Using dynamic inheritance.

The ET++SwapsManager calculation engine framework computes prices for dif-\nferent financial instruments [EG92]. Its key abstractions are Instrument and Yield-\nCurve. Different instruments are implemented as subclasses of Instrument. Yield-\nCurve calculates discount factors, which determine the present value of future\ncash flows.

This approach supports mixing and matching existing\nStrategy implementations as well as defining new ones. The Booch components [BV90] use strategies as template arguments. The Booch\ncollection classes support three different kinds of memory allocation strategies:\nmanaged (allocation out of a pool), controlled (allocations/deallocations are pro-\ntected by locks), \nand unmanaged (the normal memory allocator).

Adding new ConcreteElement classes is hard. The Visitor pattern makes it hard\nto add new subclasses of Element. Each new ConcreteElement gives rise to\na new abstract operation on Visitor and a corresponding implementation\nin every ConcreteVisitor class. Sometimes a default implementation can be\nprovided in Visitor that can be inherited by most of the Concrete \nVisitors, but\nthis is the exception rather than the rule. So the key consideration in applying the Visitor pattern is whether you are\nmostly likely to change the algorithm applied over an object structure or\nthe classes of objects that make up the structure. The Visitor class hierarchy\ncan be difficult to maintain when new ConcreteElement classes are added\nfrequently. In such cases, it's probably easier just to define operations on the\nclasses that make up the structure. If the Element class hierarchy is stable,\nbut you are continually adding operations or changing algorithms, then the\nVisitor pattern will help you manage the changes. 4. Visiting across class hierarchies. An iterator (see Iterator (257)) can visit the\nobjects in a structure as it traverses them by calling their operations.

Item Currentltem() const;\n};\nThis implies that all elements the iterator can visit have a common parent\nclass Item. Visitor does not have this restriction.

For example, in\nclass Visitor {\npublic:\n// . . . void VisitMyType(MyType*);\nvoid VisitYourType(YourType*);\n};\nMyType and YourType do not have to be related through inheritance at all. 5.

It's a well-known technique. In fact, some program-\nming languages support it directly (CLOS, for example). Languages like C++\nand Smalltalk support single-dispatch. In single-dispatch languages, two criteria determine which operation will\nfulfill a request: the name of the request and the type of receiver.

Double-dispatching lets visitors request different operations on\neach class of element.11\nThis is the key to the Visitor pattern: The operation that gets executed de-\npends on both the type of Visitor and the type of Element it visits. Instead of\nbinding operations statically into the Element interface, you can consolidate\nthe operations in a Visitor and use Accept to do the binding at run-time. Ex-\ntending the Element interface amounts to defining one new Visitor subclass\nrather than many new Element subclasses. 2. Who is responsible for traversing the object structure? A visitor must visit each\nelement of the object structure. The question is, how does it get there? We \ncan\nput responsibility for traversal in any of three places: in the object structure,\nin the visitor, or in a separate iterator object (see Iterator (257)). Often the object structure is responsible for iteration. A collection will simply\niterate over its elements, calling the Accept operation on each. A composite\nwill commonly traverse itself by having each Accept operation traverse the\nelement's children and call Accept on each of them recursively. Another solution is to use an iterator to visit the elements. In C++, \nyou could\nuse either an internal or external iterator, depending on what is available\nand what is most efficient. In Smalltalk, you usually use an internal iterator\nusing do: and a block.

{"text": "DISCUSSION OF BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS: 345\nDiscussion of Behavioral Patterns\nEncapsulating Variation\nEncapsulating variation is a theme of many behavioral patterns. When an aspect of\na program changes frequently, these patterns define an object that encapsulates that\naspect. Then other parts of the program can collaborate with the object whenever they\ndepend on that aspect. The patterns usually define an abstract class that describes the\nencapsulating object, and the pattern derives its name from that object.12 For example,\n\u2022 a Strategy object encapsulates an algorithm (Strategy (315)),\n\u2022 a State object encapsulates a state-dependent behavior (State (305)),\n\u2022 a Mediator object encapsulates the protocol between objects (Mediator (273)), and\n\u2022 an Iterator object encapsulates the way you access and traverse the components\nof an aggregate object (Iterator (257)). These patterns describe aspects of a program that are likely to change. Most patterns\nhave two kinds of objects: \nthe new object(s) that encapsulate the aspect, and the existing\nobject(s) that use the new ones. Usually the functionality of new objects would be an\nintegral part of the existing objects were it not for the pattern. For example, code for\na Strategy would probably be wired into the strategy's Context, and code for a State\nwould be implemented directly in the state's Context. But not all object behavioral patterns partition functionality like this. For example,\nChain of Responsibility (223) deals with an arbitrary number of objects (i.e., a chain),\nall of which may already exist in the system. Chain of Responsibility illustrates another difference in behavioral patterns: Not all\ndefine static communication relationships between classes. Chain of Responsibility\nprescribes communication between an open-ended number of objects. Other patterns\ninvolve objects that are passed around as arguments. Objects as Arguments\nSeveral patterns introduce an object that's always used as an argument. One of these\nis Visitor (331). A Visitor object is the argument to a polymorphic Accept operation on\nthe objects it visits. The visitor is never considered a part of those objects, even though\nthe conventional alternative to the pattern is to distribute Visitor code across the object\nstructure classes. 12 This theme runs through other kinds of patterns, too. Abstract Factory (87), Builder (97), and Proto-\ntype (117) all encapsulate knowledge about how objects are created. Decorator (175) encapsulates responsi-\nbility that can be added to an object. Bridge (151) separates an abstraction from its implementation, letting\nthem vary independently.", "domains": ["Design Patterns", "Domain-Driven Design", "Code Organization"], "source": "DesignPatternElementofResusableOOSoftware.pdf", "section": "Page 365", "position": 365, "chunk_type": "semantic", "token_estimate": 398}
{"text": "Other patterns define objects that act as magic tokens to be passed around and invoked: at a later time. Both Command (233) and Memento (283) fall into this category. In\nCommand, the token represents a request; in Memento, it represents the internal state\nof an object at a particular time. In both cases, the token can have a complex internal\nrepresentation, but the client is never aware of it. But even here there are differences. Polymorphism is important in the Command pattern, because executing the Command\nobject is a polymorphic operation. In contrast, the Memento interface is so narrow that\na memento can only be passed as a value. So it's likely to present no polymorphic\noperations at all to its clients. Should Communication be Encapsulated or Distributed? Mediator (273) and Observer (293) are competing patterns. The difference between\nthem is that Observer distributes communication by introducing Observer and Subject\nobjects, whereas a Mediator object encapsulates the communication between other\nobjects. In the Observer pattern, there is no single object that encapsulates a constraint. Instead,\nthe Observer and the Subject must cooperate to maintain the constraint. Communica-\ntion patterns are determined by the way observers and subjects are interconnected: a\nsingle subject usually has many observers, and sometimes the observer of one subject is\na subject of another observer. The Mediator pattern centralizes rather than distributes. It places the responsibility for maintaining a constraint squarely in the mediator. We've found it easier to make reusable Observers and Subjects than to make reusable\nMediators. The Observer pattern promotes partitioning and loose coupling between\nObserver and Subject, and that leads to finer-grained classes that are more apt to be \nreused. On the other hand, it's easier to understand the flow of communication in Mediator\nthan in Observer. Observers and subjects are usually connected shortly after they're\ncreated, and it's hard to see how they are connected later in the program. If you know\nthe Observer pattern, then you understand that the way observers and subjects are\nconnected is important, and you also know what connections to look for. However, the\nindirection that Observer introduces will still make a system harder to understand. Observers in Smalltalk can be parameterized with messages to access the Subject state,\nand so they are even more reusable than they are in C++.

{"text": "DISCUSSION OF BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS: 349\nSummary\nWith few exceptions, behavioral design patterns complement and reinforce each other. A class in a chain of responsibility, for example, will probably include at least one ap-\nplication of Template \nMethod (325). The template method can use primitive operations\nto determine whether the object should handle the request and to choose the object to\nforward to. The chain can use the Command pattern to represent requests as objects. Interpreter (243) can use the State pattern to define parsing contexts. An iterator can\ntraverse an aggregate, and a visitor can apply an operation to each element in the\naggregate. Behavioral patterns work well with other patterns, too. For example, a system that uses\nthe Composite (163) \npattern might use a visitor to perform operations on components \nof\nthe composition. It could use Chain of Responsibility to let components access global\nproperties through their parent. It could also use Decorator (175) to override these\nproperties on parts of the composition.

It's easy to imagine more sophisticated ways of\nusing patterns, such as pattern-based CASE tools or hypertext documents. But patterns\nare a big help even without sophisticated tools. An Adjunct to Existing Methods\nObject-oriented design methods are supposed to promote good design, to teach new\ndesigners how to design well, and to standardize the way designs are developed. A\ndesign method typically defines a set of notations (usually graphical) for modeling\nvarious aspects of a design, along with a set of rules that govern how and when to use\neach notation. Design methods usually describe problems that occur in a design, how\nto resolve them, and how to evaluate design. But they haven't been able to capture the\nexperience of expert designers. We believe our design patterns are an important piece that's been missing from object-\noriented design methods. The design patterns show how to use primitive techniques\nsuch as objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. They show how to parameterize a \nsystem with an algorithm, a behavior, a state, or the kind of objects it's supposed to\ncreate. Design patterns provide a way to describe more of the \"why\" of a design and\nnot just record the results of your decisions. The Applicability, Consequences, and\nImplementation sections of the design patterns help guide you in the decisions you\nhave to make. Design patterns are especially useful in turning an analysis model into an implementa-\ntion model. Despite many claims that promise a smooth transition from object-oriented\nanalysis to design, in practice the transition is anything but smooth. A flexible and \nreusable design will contain objects that aren't in the analysis model. The program-\nming language and class libraries you use affect the design. Analysis models often\nmust be redesigned to make them reusable. Many of the design patterns in the catalog\naddress these issues, which is why we call them design patterns. A full-fledged design method requires more kinds of patterns than just design patterns. There can also be analysis patterns, user interface design patterns, or performance-\ntuning patterns.

Roughly half of\nthe current patterns were in his thesis. By \nOOPSLA '91 it was officially an independent\ncatalog, and Richard had joined Erich to work on it. John started working on it soon\nthereafter. By \nOOPSLA '92, Ralph had joined the group. We worked hard to make the\ncatalog fit for publication at ECOOP '93, but soon we realized that a 90-page paper was\nnot going to be accepted. So we summarized the catalog and submitted the summary,\nwhich was accepted. We \ndecided to turn the catalog into a book shortly thereafter. Our names for the patterns have changed a little along the way. \"Wrapper\" became\n\"Decorator,\" \"Glue\" became \"Facade,\" \"Solitaire\" became \"Singleton,\" and \"Walker\"\nbecame \"Visitor.\" A couple of patterns got dropped because they didn't seem important\nenough. But otherwise the set of patterns in the catalog has changed little since the end\nof 1992. The patterns themselves, however, have evolved tremendously. In fact, noticing that something is a pattern is the easy part. All four of us are actively\nworking on building object-oriented systems, and we've found that it's easy to spot\npatterns when you look at enough systems. But finding patterns is much easier than\ndescribing them. If you build systems and then reflect on what you build, you will see patterns in what\nyou do. But it's hard to describe patterns so that people who don't know them will\nunderstand them and realize why they are important. Experts \nimmediately recognized \nthe value of the catalog in its early stages. But the only ones who could understand the\npatterns were those who had already used them. Since one of the main purposes of the book was to teach object-oriented design to new\ndesigners, we knew we had to improve the catalog. We expanded the average size of\na pattern from less than 2 to more than 10 pages by including a detailed motivating\nexample and sample code.

We can do that for certain classes of applications, such as\nreport-writing or making a forms-entry system. But our catalog is just a collection \nof\nrelated patterns; we can't pretend it's a pattern language.

Design patterns are just a part of a larger pattern language for software. Patterns in Software\nOur first collective experience in the study of software architecture was at an\nOOPSLA '91 workshop led by Bruce Anderson. The workshop was dedicated to de-\nveloping a handbook for software architects. (Judging from this book, we suspect\n\"architecture encyclopedia\" will be a more appropriate name than \"architecture hand-\nbook.\") That first workshop has led to a series of meetings, the most recent of which\nbeing the first conference on Pattern Languages of Programs held in August 1994. This\nhas created a community of people interested in documenting software expertise. Of course, others have had this goal as well. Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer Pro-\ngramming [Knu73] was one of the first attempts to catalog software knowledge, though\nhe focused on describing algorithms. Even so, the task proved too great to finish. The\nGraphics Gems series [Gla90, Arv91, Kir92] is another catalog of design knowledge, \nthough it too tends to focus on algorithms. The Domain Specific Software Architecture\nprogram sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense [GM92] concentrates on gather-\ning architectural information. The knowledge-based software engineering community\ntries to represent software-related knowledge in general. There are many other groups\nwith goals at least a little like ours.

We call this abstract coupling because\nA refers to a type of object, not a concrete object. abstract operation An operation that declares a signature but doesn't implement it. In\nC++, an abstract operation corresponds to a pure virtual member function. acquaintance relationship A class that refers to another class has an acquaintance with\nthat class. aggregate object An object that's composed of subobjects. The subobjects are called\nthe aggregate's parts, and the aggregate is responsible for them. aggregation relationship The relationship of an aggregate object to its parts. A class\ndefines this relationship for its instances (e.g., aggregate objects). black-box reuse A style of reuse based on object composition. Composed objects reveal\nno internal details to each other and are thus analogous to \"black boxes.\" class A class defines an object's interface and implementation.

{"text": "Type information is optional; we use the C++ convention, which puts the type name: before the name of the operation (to signify the return type), instance variable, or actual\nparameter. Slanted type indicates that the class or operation is abstract. In some design patterns it's helpful to see where client classes reference Participant\nclasses. When a pattern includes a Client class as one of its participants (meaning\nthe client has a responsibility in the pattern), the Client appears as an ordinary class. This is true in Flyweight (195), for example. When the pattern does not include a\nClient participant (i.e., clients have no responsibilities in the pattern), but including it\nnevertheless clarifies which pattern participants interact with clients, then the Client\nclass is shown in gray, as shown in Figure B.lb. An example is Proxy (207). A gray Client\nalso makes it clear that we haven't accidentally omitted the Client from the Participants\ndiscussion. Figure B.lc shows various relationships between classes. The OMT notation for class\ninheritance is a triangle connecting a subclass (LineShape in the figure) to its parent\nclass (Shape). An object reference representing a part-of or aggregation relationship is\nindicated by an arrowheaded line with a diamond at the base. The arrow points to\nthe class that is aggregated (e.g., Shape). An arrowheaded line without the diamond\ndenotes acquaintance (e.g., a LineShape keeps a reference to a Color object, which other\nshapes may share). A name for the reference may appear near the base to distinguish\nit from other references.2\nAnother useful thing to show is which classes instantiate which others. We use a\ndashed arrowheaded line to indicate this, since OMT \ndoesn't support it. We \ncall this the \n\"creates\" relationship. The arrow points to the class that's instantiated. In Figure B.lc,\nCreationTool creates LineShape objects. OMT also defines a filled circle to mean \"more than one.\" When the circle appears at\nthe head of a reference, it means multiple objects are being referenced or aggregated. Figure B.lc shows that Drawing aggregates multiple objects of type Shape. Finally, we've augmented OMT with pseudocode annotations to let us sketch the im-\nplementations of operations. Figure B.ld shows the pseudocode annotation for the\nDraw operation on the Drawing class. B.2 Object Diagram\nAn object diagram shows instances exclusively.
