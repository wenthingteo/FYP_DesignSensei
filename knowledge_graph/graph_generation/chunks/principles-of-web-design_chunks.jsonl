{"text": "before examining the specific nuances of web type, it\u2019s important to: understand a few universal principals of typography. In historical terms, a font is a complete set of characters that make up a\nsingle size, style, and weight of a typeface. The term typeface refers to the\nunique styling applied to a set of glyphs, including an alphabet of letters and\nligatures, numerals, and punctuation marks. Due largely to their use in\nrelation to computers, the two terms have evolved to be interchangeable. The\nterm font no longer refers to a single size or style, and can even refer to the\ndigital file used by the computer to display typefaces. It has been said that great typography is invisible, but that\u2019s only half the\nstory\u2014 typography can also be beautifully expressive and attention-\ngrabbing. In either case, type must carry a message to the user. The two\nopposing characteristics, which combine to attract a user and convey a\nmessage, are called readability and legibility. Both are essential for effective\ncommunication. Readability refers to how well type can attract a reader. Typographic posters,\nbook covers, packaging, logos, and magazine features, for example, must\nhave a readable quality to them in order to get the attention of a reader\u2014a\nquality that makes a person stop and want to read. Readability can come\nfrom size, font usage, composition, color usage, abstraction, or anything that\nhelps type\u2014or, more specifically, the message\u2014 stand apart. Effectively\nreadable type expresses meaning through form beyond the content of the\nwords it displays. The FedEx logo is an example of this idea.

{"text": "Before one can begin the process of implementing either on-site or external: SEO techniques, one must first determine the best keywords for the site. Keywords are the specific terms that relate directly to the content of a site\nthat people might use in their search. It\u2019s essential to select these terms\nbased on the customer\u2019s point of view\u2014not necessarily the client\u2019s point of\nview. Very often, clients speak of themselves using internal language\u2014like\nproduct names or industry terms\u2014that don\u2019t reflect how users search for\ninformation. It\u2019s important to understand how a user would define a client\u2019s\nbusiness and use terms that fit that idea. Users generally search for the solution to a problem they\u2019re experiencing:\n\u201cWhat is [blank]?\u201d \u201cI need a [blank],\u201d or \u201cWhere is [blank]?\u201d Therefore, an\neffective strategy for developing a list of keywords is to position them as\nthe answer to a question. These might be single words, but two-, three-, and\neven four-word phrases can be used. Identifying these words and phrases\ncan involve a few methods. Keyword tools such as the Google Keyword Tool, as well as third-party pay\nservices, like WordTracker, help identify terms. These services are\nconnected to a database of popular search terms and can cross-reference a\nspecific term with other, synonymous terms that may have also been used to\nfind sites related to the same topic. They can also provide information on\nthe volume, popularity, and competition of terms as well. Site-indexing tools crawl a site and provide a list of the current keyword\nmix.

A list that\u2019s too\nlong can dilute the effectiveness of each individual keyword.

Using tables, an older method\nof building page structures with rows and columns, results in longer code\nthat can push down content in the markup. The CSS styling should be\nimported from an exterior CSS style sheet to avoid having long stretches of\nCSS code in the <head> tag of a page. The same is true for JavaScript\nfunctions, or anything that can unnecessarily lengthen the markup. Images can play a role in SEO as well.
